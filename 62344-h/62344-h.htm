<small>A SINGULAR PLOT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> speedily ran amongst us of the cuddy that
the dead sailor who had been so very impressively
interred by old Keeling had returned to
the ship, and was alive in some part of her,
secure in handcuffs or in leg-irons; but so
much was made of the fire which had broken
out that Crabb&#8217;s reappearance lost as a miracle
half the weight it would have carried had it
happened alone. Besides, the sense of the
people soon gathered that the business was a
plot which had been managed with astonishing
cleverness, and it all seemed plain as mud
in a wine-glass when the whisper went round
that Hemmeridge was under arrest as an arch-conspirator
in the matter. And certainly it
made one feel far from comfortable even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
think that for the past weeks a ruffian of a
true piratical complexion had been secreted in
the ship&#8217;s hold, where his confederates would
keep him supplied with tobacco and the means
of lighting it, and where, in his borings and
pryings, he was tolerably certain to have
stumbled upon something inflammatory in the
shape of spirits. Indeed, it made me draw my
breath short when my mind went to the rum
puncheons and the powder-magazine below,
and to the vision of Crabb, drunk, stupidly
groping with a naked light in his hand, during
some midnight hour, maybe, when we were
all in bed.</p>

<p>However, the imagination of the passengers
would hardly go to these lengths. Their
thoughts held to the fire, and their talk chiefly
concerned it. When the skipper came below
for a glass of grog that night, the ladies so
baited him with questions that one pitied him
almost for not being able to enjoy the privilege
of venting his heated soul in a few strong
words.</p>

<p>&#8216;I <i>cannot</i> satisfy myself, Captain Keeling,
that the fire is utterly extinguished,&#8217; said Mrs.
Bannister.</p>

<p>&#8216;Might it not burst out again, capting?&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
cried Mrs. Hudson. &#8216;There should be plenty
of pails kept filled with water ready to empty
if smoke is smelt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Perhaps something may be on fire even
now!&#8217; exclaimed Mrs Joliffe, &#8216;something that
doesn&#8217;t make a smoke; and how <i>then</i> are the
sailors to tell if all is right in the bottom of
the ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Keeling,&#8217; cried Mrs. Trevor, &#8216;is it
quite safe to go to bed, do you think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If a fire should break out,&#8217; said Miss
Hudson in a trembling voice, as though shudder
after shudder were chasing through her, &#8216;how
can we depend upon being called? It is impossible
to hear downstairs what is going on
on deck.&#8217;</p>

<p>Poor old marline-spike made a bolt of it
at last, fairly turning tail and rushing up the
companion steps when it came to the colonel
striking in and topping off the female broadsides
by inquiries of a like nature delivered at
the very height of his pipes.</p>

<p>However, the night passed quietly; and
when next morning came and the people
assembled at breakfast, all fear of fire was
seemingly gone, and little more was talked
about than Crabb and what his designs had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
been, the topic gathering no mean accentuation
from the doctor&#8217;s vacant place. Somewhere
about ten o&#8217;clock I was standing at the taffrail
watching the ship&#8217;s wake, that was languidly
streaming off in a short oily surface, and
wondering whether, if we were to fall in with
nothing brisker than these faint airs and
draughts of wind, all hands would not have
grown white-haired and decrepit by the time
we were up with the Cape, leaving the Indian
Ocean and Bombay out of consideration, when
the head-steward came up to me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Keeling&#8217;s compliments, sir, and
he&#8217;ll feel greatly hobliged, providing you&#8217;re
not hotherwise occupied, by your stepping to
his cabin, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes, with pleasure,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Is he
alone?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is not, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>I went down the companion steps, knocked
at the captain&#8217;s door, and entered. It was a
roomy interior, a very noble ship&#8217;s berth,
occupying hard upon the width of the deck
right aft, saving, as I have before described, a
sort of small chart-room alongside, bulkheaded
off. There was a large stern window, after the
olden fashion, with the blue line of the horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
gently sliding up and down it, and a shivering
light lifting off the sea to the glass, sharp and
of a sort of azure brilliancy, as though from
diamonds set a-trembling. Keeling, in full
fig, his face showing of a dark red against
some maple-coloured ground of bulkhead or
ship&#8217;s side, was seated at a table. He instantly
rose on my entering, gave me one of his wire-drawn
bows, and motioned me to a seat, thanking
me in a few words for coming. On the
starboard hand stood Crabb and the sailmaker,
handcuffed, and on either side of them was a
seaman with a cutlass dangling at his hip.
On the port hand sat Dr. Hemmeridge, his
legs crossed, his thumbs in the armholes of
his waistcoat, and his head drooped. He was
deadly pale, and looked horribly ill and worried.
Near him was one of the sailors, a young fellow
of some seven or eight and twenty, with a
quantity of hair falling over his brow, a straggling
beard, and small black eyes, which
roamed swiftly in glances charged methought
with the spirit of mutiny and menace and
defiance. Mr. Prance was at the captain&#8217;s
elbow; and the third mate was seated at an
end of the table with a pen in his hand and
some paper in front of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>I bowed to Hemmeridge, but he took no
notice. Until the captain addressed me, I
stared hard at Crabb; for even now, with the
ugly ruffian standing before me, my mind found
it difficult to realise that he was alive; that
the creature I gazed at was the man whom all
hands of us, with an exception or two, supposed
overboard a thousand fathoms deep.
There was, besides, the fascination of his
ugliness. The hunch-like curve of his back,
his little blood-stained eyes looking away from
his nose, as though they sought to peer at
something at the back of his head, the greasy
trail of carroty hair upon his back, the fragment
of nose over his hare-lip, these and the
rest of him combined into the representation
of the most extravagantly grotesque, ill-favoured
figure ever witnessed outside the
bars of a menagerie. The sailmaker&#8217;s face
was as white as one of his bolts of canvas,
but it wore a determined look, though I
noticed a quivering in the nostrils of his high-perched
nose, and a constant uneasy movement
of the fingers, as of dying hands plucking at
bedclothes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; exclaimed old Keeling with
the dignity and gravity of a judge, &#8216;I&#8217;ve taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the liberty to send for you, as I am informed
by Mr. Prance that when that man there&#8217;&mdash;inclining
his head towards Crabb without looking
at him&mdash;&#8216;was lying, as it was supposed,
dead in his bunk, you accompanied Mr.
Hemmeridge, the ship&#8217;s surgeon&#8217;&mdash;here he
indicated the doctor with a motion of his head
but without looking at him either&mdash;&#8216;into the
forecastle, and stood for some considerable
time surveying the so-called corpse.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That is quite true,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did Mr. Hemmeridge expose the man&#8217;s
face to you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He did.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What impression was produced upon your
mind by the sight of the&mdash;of the&mdash;body?&#8217;</p>

<p>Crabb gave a horrible grin.</p>

<p>&#8216;That he was stone-dead, Captain Keeling;
so stone-dead, sir, that I can scarcely credit
the man himself is now before me.&#8217;</p>

<p>Hemmeridge looked up and fixed his eyes
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is but reasonable I should inform you,
Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; continued old marline-spike,
&#8216;that Mr. Hemmeridge is under arrest on suspicion
of conspiring with Crabb, with Willett,
and with Thomas Bobbins&#8217;&mdash;he glanced at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
man who stood next to the doctor&mdash;&#8216;to plunder
the ship. Bobbins has given evidence that
leaves me in no doubt as to the guilt of Crabb
and Willett.&#8217;</p>

<p>Crabb uttered a curse through his teeth,
accompanied with a look at the young seaman,
in the one-eyed gleam of which murder methought
was writ too large to be mistaken for
any other intention. Old Keeling did not heed
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bobbins&#8217;s story,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;is to this
effect: that Crabb was to swallow a potion
which would produce the appearance of death;
that the sailmaker was to have a hammock
weighted, shaped, and in all respects equipped
to resemble the one in which Crabb would be
stitched up: that in the dead of night, when
the ship was silent, and the deck forward
vacant, the sham hammock was to be placed
upon the fore-hatch by the sailmaker and
Bobbins, and the cover containing that man&#8217;&mdash;inclining
his head at Crabb&mdash;&#8216;conveyed into
the sailmaker&#8217;s cabin, where it was to be cut
open, the man freed, and secreted in the berth
till consciousness had returned, and he was in
a fit state to seize the first opportunity of
sneaking into the hold. All this was done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8217;
old Keeling went on, Mr. Prance meanwhile
looking as grave as an owl over the skipper&#8217;s
shoulder, whilst every now and again a hideous
grin would distort Crabb&#8217;s frightful mouth,
though the sailmaker continued to stare at the
captain with a white and determined countenance,
and Hemmeridge to listen with a frowning
worried look, his leg that crossed the other
swinging like a pendulum. &#8216;The man Crabb
got into the hold, was supplied with food
and drink by Willett and Bobbins, and with
tools to enable him to break into the mail-room&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;And I&#8217;d ha&#8217; done it too,&#8217; here interrupted
Crabb in a voice like a saw going through a
balk of timber, &#8216;if it hadn&#8217;t been for the
stinking smoke of them blasted blankets.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This inquiry,&#8217; continued Keeling, &#8216;now
entirely concerns Mr. Hemmeridge. You tell
me, Mr. Dugdale, that Crabb seemed to you as
a stone-dead man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The devil himself couldn&#8217;t ha&#8217; told the
difference,&#8217; bawled Crabb. &#8216;<i>He&#8217;s</i> not in it,&#8217;
insolently motioning with his elbow towards
the doctor. &#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t that blooming Bobbins
ha&#8217; said so?&#8217; and he darted another murderous
glance at the hairy young sailor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>&#8216;I can assure you, Captain Keeling,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;that the man was perfectly dead. There is
not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that Mr.
Hemmeridge was fully convinced the body was
a corpse. Convinced, captain, but dissatisfied
too; and perhaps,&#8217; said I, with a glance at
Crabb, &#8216;it is a pity for more sakes than one
that he did not carry out his idea of a post-mortem
examination.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; exclaimed Hemmeridge in
a low, deep, trembling voice, &#8216;before God and
man, I am innocent; and I hope to live to call
Captain Keeling to account for this monstrous
slander, this enormous suspicion, this dishonourable
and detestable accusation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve never heered,&#8217; said the man named
Bobbins, in a long-drawn whining voice, &#8216;that
this gent was consarned. I remembered Crabb
asking what was to be done if so be the surgeon
should cut him up to see what he died of, and
Mr. Willett kissed the Bible afore Crabb and
me to this: that if the surgeon made up his
mind to open Crabb, Willett was to show him
the bottle of physic, and to tell him that
Crabb had took it for some bad complaint,
and that, though he might look dead, he
worn&#8217;t so.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>Crabb hove a fearful curse at the man.
The bushy-whiskered sailor who guarded him
on the right significantly put his hand upon
the hilt of his cutlass whilst he said something
to him under his breath.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is new to me,&#8217; exclaimed Keeling,
screwing his eye gimlet-fashion into the face of
Bobbins, and then letting it drop, as if satisfied.
&#8216;Mr. Hemmeridge, I have <i>suspected</i> you,
sir; but it&#8217;s a little soon for you to talk of my
having <i>accused</i> you. You are a medical man.
If anybody knows death by looking upon it
you should. Yet, though this man Crabb is
merely counterfeiting death, you come aft to
me and report him dead! What am I to infer?
Your ignorance or your guilt, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Keeling,&#8217; cried I, &#8216;believe me
when I promise you the man was not <i>counterfeiting</i>
death. He was to all intents and purposes
a corpse. How was this brought about?
Surely by no exercise of his own art. The
look of the eye&mdash;the droop of the jaw&mdash;the
hue of the skin&mdash;Captain Keeling, it was death
to the sight: no counterfeit&mdash;an effect produced
by something much more powerful than
the effort of such a will as that man has;&#8217;
and I pointed with my thumb at Crabb, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
told me with a curse to mind my own business.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale, I thank you,&#8217; said Hemmeridge,
bowing to me.</p>

<p>Captain Keeling held up a long thin phial
about three-quarters full of a dark liquor. I
had not before noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8216;This has been produced,&#8217; said he, &#8216;by the
man Bobbins, who states that it is the stuff
which Crabb swallowed, and which caused
the death-like aspect you saw in him.&#8217; He put
the bottle down; then clenching his fist, smote
the table violently. &#8216;I cannot credit it!&#8217; he
cried. &#8216;I cannot be imposed on. Am I to
believe that there is any drug in existence
which will produce in a living being the exact
semblance of death?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I think so, sir,&#8217; said Prance, speaking
mildly.</p>

<p>Hemmeridge sneered.</p>

<p>&#8216;A semblance of death,&#8217; roared old Keeling,
twisting round upon his chief mate, &#8216;capable
of deceiving the eye&mdash;the practised eye of a
medical man? You may give me a dose of
laudanum, and I may look dead to you, sir,
but not to Mr. Hemmeridge yonder. No, sir;
I am not to be persuaded,&#8217; and here he brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
his fist down upon the table again. &#8216;It is
either gross ignorance or direct connivance,
and I mean to be satisfied&mdash;I mean to sift it
to the bottom&mdash;I mean to get at the truth,
by&mdash;&mdash;!&#8217;</p>

<p>His face was full of blood, and he puffed
and blew like a swimmer struggling for his
life.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ve got the truth, and be so-and-so to
you,&#8217; broke in Crabb.</p>

<p>The armed sailor ground his elbow into the
fellow&#8217;s ribs.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am merely here to answer your questions,
Captain Keeling,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and must
apologise for taking a single step beyond the
object you had in calling me to you; but at
least permit me to ask, cannot Mr. Hemmeridge
explain the nature of the drug contained in
that bottle?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not know what it is,&#8217; exclaimed
Hemmeridge.</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose, sir,&#8217; said Mr. Prance, &#8216;we give
Crabb another dose; then you&#8217;ll be able to
judge for yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t give me no more doses!&#8217; said
Crabb. &#8216;Try it on yourselves.&#8217;</p>

<p>The captain sat a little, looking at me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
vacantly, lost in thought. He suddenly turned
to Hemmeridge.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are at liberty, sir; I remove the
arrest.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And is that all?&#8217; exclaimed the other,
after a brief pause, viewing him steadily. &#8216;I
must have an apology, sir; an apology ample,
abundant, satisfying.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will see you&#8217;&mdash;began old Keeling,
then checked himself. &#8216;You can leave this
cabin, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>Hemmeridge rose from his chair. &#8216;I leave
this cabin, sir,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and I also leave my
duties. Professionally, I do no more in this
ship, sir. You have disgraced, you have dishonoured
me. But,&#8217; said he, shaking his
finger at him, &#8216;you shall make me amends at
Bombay, sir&mdash;you shall make me amends at
Bombay!&#8217;</p>

<p>He stalked from the cabin, old Keeling
watching him with a frown, but in silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; I exclaimed, rising as the door
closed behind the doctor, &#8216;I am persuaded
that Mr. Hemmeridge is innocent of all participation
in this bad business. You have on
board a gentleman who, I believe, has a very
extensive knowledge of drugs and herbs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the like&mdash;I mean Mr. Saunders. It is just
possible he might know the nature of the contents
of that bottle.&#8217;</p>

<p>Keeling reflected a minute, and then said:
&#8216;Mr. Prance, send my compliments to Mr.
Saunders, and ask him to my cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate went out; I was following him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, stay a little, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; said the
skipper.&mdash;&#8216;Men, take those fellows forward.&mdash;Remain
where you are,&#8217; he added, turning to
Bobbins.</p>

<p>A seaman flung open the door, and Crabb
and the sailmaker passed out, followed by the
second armed sailor, who silenced some blasphemous
abuse that Crabb had paused to
deliver, by giving him a shove that drove him
headlong into the cuddy.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am sorry to detain you, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217;
said the captain. &#8216;Mr. Saunders is a rather
nervous gentleman, and it might be agreeable
to him to find you here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You do not detain me, Captain Keeling.
This is an amazing business, almost too
wonderful in its way to believe in. Have
you ascertained how Crabb became possessed
of that magical drug?&mdash;and magical it must
be, captain, for I give you my word that never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
showed any corpse deader than that fellow
when Hemmeridge removed the canvas from
his face.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I beg your honour&#8217;s pardon,&#8217; exclaimed
Bobbins, preserving his lamenting and whining
voice, and knuckling his forehead as he spoke,
whilst I could see old Keeling lifting his eyes
to him with disgust and aversion strong in his
purple countenance. &#8216;Mr. Willett told me
that Crabb &#8217;ud say he&#8217;d got that there stuff off
a travelling Jew that he fell in with at some
Mediterranean port. He bought two lots of
it, and tried a dose on a man who took it unbeknown,
reckoning it good for spasms. He
believed as it had killed the chap, sich was
his corpse-like swound; but he come to all
right arter four-and-twenty hours, and niver
knowed nothen about it, and believed it still
to be Monday when it were Toosday. This
put the scheme he tried on here into his
head.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Has he ever attempted anything of the
same sort before?&#8217; inquired Keeling.</p>

<p>&#8216;I dunno, sir. He&#8217;s a bad un. It &#8217;ud
make a marble heffigy sweat to hear him talk
in his sleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the cabin door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Mr. Prance ushered in Mr. Saunders. The little
chap looked very small as he entered, holding
his large hat in his hand. He was pale, and
stared up at us with something of alarm as we
rose to his entrance, the skipper giving him the
same hide-bound bow that he had greeted me
with.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is Mr. Saunders acquainted with the story
of this business, Mr. Prance?&#8217; old Keeling inquired.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; replied the mate. &#8216;I gave him
the substance of it in a few words as we came
along.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is extremely startling,&#8217; said the little
man, climbing on to the chair into which old
Keeling had waved him, and dangling his short
legs over the edge as a small boy might.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your knowledge of drugs and medicines,
Mr. Saunders, is, I believe, very considerable?&#8217;
said the skipper. The little fellow bowed.
&#8216;This,&#8217; said Keeling, holding up the phial, &#8216;is
a drug, the stupefying effects of which, I am
informed, are so remarkable that any one who
takes it entirely loses animation, and presents
such an aspect of death as will deceive the
eye of the most expert medical practitioner.
Is such a thing conceivable, Mr. Saunders?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>The little man reflected very earnestly for
some moments, with his eyes fixed upon
Keeling. He then asked Mr. Prance to hand
him the phial, which he uncorked, and smelt
and tasted.</p>

<p>&#8216;I cannot be positive,&#8217; he exclaimed, with
a slow, wise shake of his large head; &#8216;but I
strongly suspect this to be what is known as
<i>morion</i>, the death-wine of Pliny and Dioscorides.
Mr. Dugdale, observe the strange,
peculiar faint smell&mdash;what does it suggest?&#8217;</p>

<p>I put the bottle to my nose and sniffed.
&#8216;Opium will it be, Mr. Saunders?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just so,&#8217; he cried. &#8216;Captain Keeling,
smell you, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>The old skipper applied the bottle to his
nostrils and snuffled a little. &#8216;I should call
this a kind of opium,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;If,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Saunders, &#8216;it be morion,
as I believe it is, it is made from the mandragora
or mandrake of the kind that flourishes
in Greece and Palestine and in certain parts
of the Mediterranean seaboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But am I to understand,&#8217; said Keeling,
&#8216;that a dose of it is going to make a man look
as dead as if he were killed?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The effect of morion,&#8217; responded Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Saunders, &#8216;is that of suspended animation,
scarcely distinguishable from death.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Could it deceive a qualified man such as
Dr. Hemmeridge?&#8217; demanded the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should think it very probable,&#8217; answered
little Saunders cautiously; &#8216;in fact, sir, as we
have seen, he <i>was</i> deceived by the effects of
that drug, be it morion or anything else.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You can go forward,&#8217; said the captain to
Bobbins.</p>

<p>The fellow flourished a hand to his brow
and left the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Saunders, I am obliged to you, sir,
for your information,&#8217; continued old Keeling.
&#8216;I trust to have your opinion confirmed
either in Bombay or in London. To me it
seems a very incredible thing. Mr. Dugdale,
I thank you for the trouble you have given
yourself to attend here.&#8217;</p>

<p>He bowed; and little Saunders and myself,
accompanied by Mr. Prance, entered the
cuddy.</p>

<p>&#8216;A most extraordinary business altogether,&#8217;
cried the little man: &#8216;it is wonderful enough,
supposing the stuff to be morion, that a
common sailor should be in possession of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a drug; but much more wonderful yet that
it should occur to him to employ it as an
instrument in probably the most audacious
project ever adventured on board ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hemmeridge might have opened Crabb,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, the rogue foresaw it, and provided
against it, as we know,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Prance.
&#8216;There is pocketable booty in the mail-room
to the value of hard upon a hundred and fifty
thousand pounds. A man like Crabb will run
risks for such plunder, Mr. Dugdale. If the
sailmaker had kept his word and produced
the bottle to Hemmeridge, the doctor would
have been pretty sure to stay his hand.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, likely as not,&#8217; I exclaimed: &#8216;but
tell me, Mr. Prance&mdash;that fellow Bobbins
seems to have been coaxed very easily into
peaching.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said he; &#8216;there&#8217;d been an ugly
quarrel between him and Willett ten days ago.
I believe the rascal would not have split
whilst Crabb lay snug and secret in the hold,
but on his showing himself, Bobbins took
fright, thought of his neck, and being actuated
besides by hatred of Willett, came forward and
volunteered the whole yarn.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8216;And how is he to be served?&#8217; inquired
Mr. Saunders.</p>

<p>&#8216;Left to be at large, sir,&#8217; answered the
mate; &#8216;and punishment enough, too, as any
one may suppose, of a false-hearted, lily-livered
shipmate who has to swing his hammock three
or four months among a forecastle full of
hands. For my part,&#8217; added he with a laugh,
&#8216;if I were that miscreant, I&#8217;d rather be snug
in irons along with Willett and the cast-eyed
pirate, stowed safe out of sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>He entered his cabin, and Mr. Saunders
and I stepped on to the quarter-deck.</p>

CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>WE SIGHT A WRECK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wonder and excitement raised in us by
the extraordinary forecastle conspiracy to
plunder the ship&#8217;s mail-room passed away in
two or three days. Monotony at sea is heavy
and flattening. It passes over the soul as an
iron roller over a lawn, and smoothes down
every asperity of memory into the merest flatness
of moods and humours. Hemmeridge
showed himself no more. I never again saw
him whilst I was in the <i>Countess Ida</i>. He lay
hid in his cabin, where he was fed, by the
captain&#8217;s orders, from the cuddy table; but
he refused to leave his berth, swore he would
not prescribe so much as a pill though a pestilence
should fall upon the whole ship&#8217;s company,
and virtually left us all without the
means of obtaining professional advice. His
part in Crabb&#8217;s and the sailmaker&#8217;s scheme
was vehemently discussed, as you will suppose.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
The colonel of course was without a shadow
of a doubt of his guilt; but the rest of us,
saving Mr. Johnson, who declined to give an
opinion, considered him as wholly innocent.</p>

<p>Little Saunders gave himself a small air of
importance as a person referred to by the
captain on his knowledge of herbs, and strutted
on the merits of his suspicion that the liquor
was what he called morion. He took me into
his cabin, and climbing into his bunk, produced
a folio volume half the size of himself,
with which he dropped upon the deck, hugging
the book to his heart as though it were
his wife.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here,&#8217; said he, opening the volume and
pointing at it and looking up into my face, &#8216;is
an account of the growth out of which morion
is extracted. That,&#8217; continued he, still pointing
with a little forefinger and a long white
nail, &#8216;is a picture of the plant in flower. This
is an illustration of the young fruit. Here is
the ovary, and here is the stamen. It is, in
short, the well known mandragora of Hippocrates.
It consists of three or four species of
stemless herbs, perennial,&#8217; said he, carrying his
eyes to the book, &#8216;and very hardy. Their
roots are large and thick; and, as I told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
captain,&#8217; cried he with a little movement of
triumph, and pointing to the sentence eagerly,
&#8216;it is an inhabitant of the Mediterranean
parallels.&#8217;</p>

<p>And then the little chap read out a long
description of the flowers of the mandrake, of
the corolla and lobes, of the berries and leaves,
and I know not what else besides, in all of
which my ignorant ear could find nothing of
the smallest interest.</p>

<p>He afterwards went with his big book to
the skipper, who, Mr. Prance told me, was
impressed, though he was not to be persuaded.</p>

<p>&#8216;He will not believe,&#8217; said the chief officer,
&#8216;that there can be any aspect in a living body
to deceive a medical man into a belief that the
person is dead. I said to him: &#8220;How about
the folks that are buried alive, sir?&#8221; He
answered: &#8220;They are unhappy wretches,
whom ignorant and gross persons, calling
themselves medical men, lightly glance at
and pronounce dead, and hurry away from.
Hemmeridge would know better, sir. He <i>does</i>
know better. I cannot satisfy myself that he
could not distinguish life in that man Crabb.
And what&#8217;s the inference then? No matter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sir. I will have this thing gone closely into
when we arrive at Bombay.&#8221; Captain Keeling
is an obstinate old sailor, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; continued
the mate. &#8216;In truth, Hemmeridge is
as innocent as you or I.&#8217;</p>

<p>Three days passed away. All this while
the Indiaman was scarcely doing more than
rippling through it. It was hard to realise
that we were out in the mid-heart almost of
one of old earth&#8217;s mightiest oceans, so peaceful
was the water, so still the heavens, so placid
the dim sultry distances, where sky and sea
were blended in a blue faintness, out of the
north-west corner of which the light wind
blew without power enough to swing the foot
of the courses or to put a twinkle into the tall
moon-coloured cloths of the topmast studdingsails.</p>

<p>It was a Monday morning, as very well
indeed do I remember. I went on deck at
about seven o&#8217;clock for a bath; and on looking
over the forecastle rail, down away upon the
starboard bow I caught sight of something
sparkling that might very well have passed for
the reflection in the water of a brilliant
luminary. The old Scotch carpenter was
leaning against the forecastle capstan smoking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
a pipe, his weather-hardened face of leather
drooping over his folded arms.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, what is that object shining down
there?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it puzzled me, sir,&#8217; he answered,
slowly raising his head, and then leisurely
staring in the direction of the appearance:
&#8216;It&#8217;s naething mair nor less than a ship&#8217;s hull,
sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>By this time I was able to distinguish a
bit clearer, and could trace, amid the delicate
haze of silver glory that was hanging all over
the sea that way, as it came in gushing and
floating folds of magnificence from the sun
that was already many degrees above the
horizon, the outline of the hull of a small
vessel, the proportions so faint as to be almost
illusive. She was too far distant to exhibit
much more than the mere flash she made, yet
she was an object to constrain the attention in
that wide blank shining calm of sea, and I
lingered a little while looking at her, meanwhile
yarning with the old carpenter about
Crabb and the sailmaker and the incident of
the fire, and such matters.</p>

<p>At breakfast there was some talk about
this hull, and Mr. Emmett told the captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that he hoped a shot would be sent at her, as
who was to know but that another cargo of
monkeys might be exorcised out of the fabric.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should rather like to visit a wreck,&#8217; I
heard Miss Temple say across the table to Mr.
Colledge: &#8216;I mean, of course, an abandoned
vessel floating in the middle of the ocean.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I protest I would rather die than think of
such a thing,&#8217; exclaimed her aunt.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said Colledge; &#8216;it
would be something to do and something to
talk about. Did you ever board a wreck,
Captain Keeling?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I would choose a wreck,&#8217; continued Miss
Temple, in her clear, rich, somewhat trembling
voice, but with an air that let you know she
confined her speech to Mrs. Radcliffe and the
young sprig opposite, and old marline-spike,
as I love to call him, &#8216;that had been abandoned
for months, indeed for years, if such a thing
could be: a hull covered with shells and weed
and grass, into which the spirit of the enormous
loneliness of the wide ocean had entered,
so that you could get to think of her as a creation
of the sea itself, as an uninhabited island
is, or a noble seabird. Think,&#8217; she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fixing her large dark eyes upon Colledge with
a light, almost sarcastic smile flickering about
her lips, as though she was perfectly sensible
that her thoughts and language were a trifle
taller than that honourable young gentleman&#8217;s
intellectual stature rose to&mdash;&#8216;think of being
utterly alone during a long, breathless, moonlit
night on board such a wreck as I am imagining.
The stillness! the imaginations which
would come shaping out of the shadows! By
putting one&#8217;s ear to the hatchway, as you
sailors call it, Captain Keeling, what should
one be able to hear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The noise of water washing about below,
ma&#8217;am&mdash;I don&#8217;t see what else,&#8217; answered the
old skipper, stiffening up his figure, whilst
he adjusted his cravat, and gazing at her with
a highly literal countenance over the points of
his shirt collars.</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him; her head
had drooped, as though to a sudden engrossing
thought, and her gaze rested upon something
which her delicate fingers toyed with
upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;What very odd fancies you have, Louise,&#8217;
exclaimed Mrs. Radcliffe with a peck of her
face at the girl&#8217;s handsome profile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&#8216;Rather a good subject for a descriptive
article, Johnson,&#8217; exclaimed Emmett aside with
a drawl.</p>

<p>&#8216;Or for a picture,&#8217; answered Johnson;
&#8216;better on canvas than on paper, I think;
don&#8217;t you, Mr. Saunders? Calm sea&mdash;a moon
up in the air&mdash;a wreck showing black against
the white reflection under the planet&mdash;a
haughty young lady&#8217;&mdash;here he softened his
voice&mdash;&#8216;inclining her head to the fore-hatch
with her hand to her ear.&mdash;A first-class idea,
Emmett. Seize it, or it may occur to another
man.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple was speaking again, but the
rude imbecile jabber of the journalist prevented
me from hearing her; and bestowing
a sea-blessing on his head under my breath, I
left the table and went on deck.</p>

<p>There was every promise of a dead calm
anon. The sea looked like ice in places with
the bluish glint of the brine that softened the
lines and curves betwixt the crawlings of the
air into a tender contrast for the lustrous
azure of the water where it was touched by the
wind. It was a high, hot, cloudless morning,
the topmost canvas, white as milk, looking
dizzy up in the blue, as though it trembled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
some sultry belt of atmosphere there. I went
to the rail to view the wreck, and instantly
made out on the other side of her the shining
square of a sail&mdash;some ship on the rim of
the horizon that had crawled into sight since
six bells of the morning watch, and was now
creeping down the smooth plain of sea with
her yards braced somewhat forward, making
a wind for herself out of what was scarce
more than a catspaw to us, who had the thin
fanning nearly over the stern.</p>

<p>Prance came up from the breakfast table
with a telescope in his hand and stood by my
side.</p>

<p>&#8216;That ship down yonder grows,&#8217; he exclaimed,
pointing the glass and speaking with
his eye at it; &#8216;there&#8217;ll be more air stirring
down there than here; but little enough anywhere
presently, though I tell you what, Mr
Dugdale, there&#8217;s drop enough in the mercury
to inspire one with hope.&#8217;</p>

<p>He brought the telescope to bear upon
the hull, and was silent for a few moments,
whilst I waited impatiently for him to make
an end, wanting to look too.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t think I can be mistaken,&#8217; said he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
presently in a musing voice: &#8216;look you, Mr.
Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;At what?&#8217; said I, as I took the glass from
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;At the hull yonder.&#8217;</p>

<p>I put the telescope upon the rail and knelt
to it. Points which were invisible to the
naked sight were clear enough now. The wreck
was that of a vessel of some two hundred and
fifty tons. She sat very light or high upon
the water, and it was a part of the copper
that rose to her bends which had emitted the
flash that caught my eye on the forecastle.
Her foremast was standing, and her foreyard
lay crossed upon it. Her bowsprit also forked
out, but the jib-booms were gone. Lengths
of her bulwark were smashed level to the
deck; but gaunt as her mastless condition
made her look, miserable as she showed in
the mutilation of her sides, the beautiful
shape of the hull stole out upon the sight
through the deformities of her wrecked condition,
as the fine shape of a woman expresses
itself in defiance of the beggar&#8217;s rags which
may clothe her.</p>

<p>&#8216;By George, then, Mr. Prance&mdash;why, yes,
to be sure! I see what you mean,&#8217; I cried all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on a sudden&mdash;&#8216;that must be our buccaneering
friend of the other day!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Neither more nor less,&#8217; said he; &#8216;an odd
rencontre certainly, considering what a big
place the sea is. And yet I don&#8217;t know: such
a clipper will have sailed two feet to our one,
though she exposed no more than her foresail.
She&#8217;ll have run as we did, and the light airs
and baffling weather which followed will easily
account for this meeting.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She is not yet the handful of charred
staves you thought her, Mr. Prance,&#8217; said I;
&#8216;they managed to get the fire under anyway,
though they had to abandon the brig in the
end. What is that fellow beyond her? She
has the look of a man-of-war: a ship, I
believe: yes, I think I can catch sight of the
yards on the mizzen peeping past the sails on
the main.&#8217;</p>

<p>All her canvas had risen, but nothing of
her hull, saving the black film of her bulwark
hovering upon the horizon with an icy gleam
betwixt it and the sea-line, as though there
was no more of her than that. When the
others came on deck there was no little excitement
amongst them on learning that the hull
was neither more nor less than the veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
wreck of the brig whose presence had filled
us with alarm and misery a few days before.
Glasses of all sorts were brought to bear upon
her, and by this time it was to be ascertained
without doubt that she was absolutely deserted;
&#8216;unless,&#8217; I heard Mr. Emmett say to Mr. Prance,
&#8216;her people should be lying concealed within,
hoping to coax us to visit her by an appearance
of being deserted, when, of course, they would
cut us off, and plunder our remains&mdash;I mean,
those who would be fools enough to board her
out of curiosity.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Likely as not,&#8217; Mr. Prance answered with
a sour smile. &#8216;I would advise you not to attempt
to inspect her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not I,&#8217; answered the painter; and the chief
officer turned abruptly from him to smother a
laugh.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before the delicate
miracle of distant canvas shining past the hull
upon the calm blue like some spire of alabaster
was recognised as a man-of-war, not alone by
the cut of her canvas and by other peculiarities
aloft readily determinable by the seafaring
eye, but by the chequered band upon her hull,
that had mounted fair to the firm crystal-like
rim of the ocean, and by the line of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hammock-cloths that crowned her tall defences.
She was some small corvette or ship-sloop, with
her nationality to be sworn to even all that
way off.</p>

<p>&#8216;An Englishman, do you think, Captain
Keeling?&#8217; asked Colonel Bannister.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, God bless my heart, yes, sir,&#8217; answered
the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, <i>how</i> do you know, capting?&#8217; cried
Mrs. Hudson.</p>

<p>&#8216;By my instincts as a Briton, ma&#8217;am,&#8217; he
answered; &#8216;patriotism so enlarges the nostril
that a man can taste with his nose whenever
anything of his country&#8217;s about in the air.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To think of it now!&#8217; exclaimed Mrs.
Hudson. &#8216;I&#8217;m sorry the robbers have left that
wreck. I should like the pirates to have been
caught by the man-of-war and hung up.&#8217;</p>

<p>The hour of noon had been &#8216;made,&#8217; as it
is called at sea, and it was then a dead calm,
with the clear chimes of eight bells ringing
through a wonderful stillness on high, so faint
was the undulation in the water, so soft the
stir in the canvas to the gentle swaying of the
tall spars. The wreck of the brig lay about
two miles distant off the starboard beam, and
by this hour the corvette, as she now proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to be, with the crimson cross fluttering at her
peak, had floated to within a mile and a half
or thereabouts on the other side of the hull;
and thus the three of us lay. The corvette,
slewing her length out to us to the twist of
some subtle current upon the still surface,
showed a very handsome stately figure of a
ship, at that distance at least. Her sails had
the fairy-like delicacy of silver tint you observe
in the moon when she hangs in an afternoon
sky; they fitted the yardarms to perfection,
and I stood admiring for a long quarter of an
hour at a time the graceful lines of the bolt-ropes
faintly curving to the yardarm sheave-holes,
each clew looking a little way past the
corner of the sail beneath it. A gilt figure-head
of some royal device flashed at her bows and
shed a ruddy gleam upon the water under it.
There was the glistering of gilt about her
quarter-galleries, and the sparkle of glass there.
But Mr. Prance said that he would swear she
was an old ship, her timbers as soft as cheese,
and her chain-pumps nearly worn out with
plying, for all that she looked in the perspective
of that azure atmosphere as airy a beauty as
ever gave the milk-white bosoms of her canvas
to the wind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>I went down on the quarter-deck to smoke
a pipe, and whilst I lay over the bulwark rail
watching the man-of-war, my eye was taken
by a somewhat curious appearance in the line
of the ocean away down in the south-west
quarter. It was a sensible depression in the
edge of the sea, as though you viewed it through
defective window-glass. It was an atmospheric
effect, and an odd one. The circle went round
with the clearness of the side of a lens, save
to that part, and there it looked as though
some gigantic knife had pared a piece clean
out&mdash;with this addition: that there was a
curious sort of faintness as of mist where the
sky joined the sea in the hollow of this queer
dip. I ran my eye over the poop to see if
others up there were noting this appearance,
but I did not observe that it had won attention.
For my part, I should have made nothing of
it, accepting it as some trick of refraction, but
for it somehow entering into my head to remember
how the second mate of the ship I had
made my first voyage in once told me of a
sudden shift of weather that had taken his craft
aback and wrecked her to her tops, and that it
had been heralded, though there was no man
to interpret the sign, by just such another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
horizontal depression as that upon which my
eyes were now resting.</p>

<p>However, on dismounting from the bulwarks
for a brief yarn with little Saunders, the
matter went out of my mind and I thought no
more of it.</p>

<p>Whilst we were at lunch, Mr. Cocker came
down the companion steps cap in hand, and said
something to the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;All right, sir,&#8217; I heard old Keeling answer:
&#8216;it will be a visit of curiosity rather than of
courtesy. How far is the boat?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s only just left the wreck, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well, Mr. Cocker.&#8217;</p>

<p>The second mate remounted the steps.</p>

<p>&#8216;The corvette,&#8217; exclaimed old Keeling, addressing
us generally, &#8216;has sent a boat to the
wreck, presumably to overhaul and report
upon her. The boat is now approaching us.
I have little doubt that the corvette is homeward
bound, in which case, ladies and gentlemen,
you might be glad to send letters by her.
There will be plenty of time. The calm, I fear,
threatens to last.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was instantly a hurry amongst the
passengers, most of whom rushed away from
the table to write their letters.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>I emptied my wine-glass and went on deck,
and saw a man-of-war&#8217;s boat approaching us;
the bright ash oars rose and fell with exquisite
precision, and the white water spat from the
stem of the little craft as she was swept through
it by the rowers, with a young fellow in the
uniform of a naval lieutenant of that day
steering her. She came flashing alongside;
up rose the oars, the lively hearty in the bows
hooked on, and the officer, lightly springing
on to the rope ladder which had been dropped
over the side for his convenience, gained the
deck with a twist of his thumb that was meant
as a salutation to the ship.</p>

<p>Old Keeling was now on the poop, and Mr.
Cocker conducted the lieutenant to him. I
happened to be standing near, talking with
Colledge and Mrs. Radcliffe, Miss Temple not
yet having returned with the letter which she
had gone to her cabin to write. The skipper
received the naval officer with a gracious
bow.</p>

<p>&#8216;Our captain,&#8217; exclaimed the young fellow,
in a gentlemanly easy way, &#8216;instructed me to
overhaul yonder wreck, and then come on
to you to see if we can be of any service;&#8217;
and I saw his eye rest with an expression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
delight upon Miss Hudson, who rose through
the companion at that instant and drew close
to hear what passed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; cried old Keeling, with another bow,
&#8216;I am obliged to your captain, sir. It is, sir,
very considerate of him to send. My passengers
are preparing letters, and we shall be
very sensible of your goodness in receiving
and transmitting them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, what ship is this, sir?&#8217; exclaimed
the lieutenant, glancing about him with the
curiosity of a stranger, and then taking
another thirsty peep at the golden young
lady.</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Countess Ida</i>, sir, of and from London
for Bombay, so many days out. And pray,
what ship is that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;His Majesty&#8217;s ship <i>Magicienne</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>Colledge started. &#8216;Beg pardon,&#8217; he
exclaimed. &#8216;Isn&#8217;t Sir Edward Panton her
commander?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is,&#8217; answered the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;By George, my cousin!&#8217; cried Colledge;
&#8216;haven&#8217;t seen him these seven years. How
doocid odd, now, to fall in with him <i>here</i>!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, indeed,&#8217; said the lieutenant, with a
hint of respect in his manner that might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
been wanting in it before. &#8216;May I venture to
ask your name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Colledge.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah! of course; a son of my Lord Sandown.
This will be news for Sir Edward.&#8217; He sent
a look at the corvette, as though measuring
the distance between the vessels.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; here said old Keeling, &#8216;I believe that
luncheon is still upon the table. Let me
conduct you below, sir. It will have been a
mighty hot ride for you out upon those unsheltered
waters.&#8217;</p>

<p>The lieutenant bowed, and followed the
skipper to the companion. Colledge put his
arm through mine and led me to the rail.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, Dugdale,&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;I should
like to see my cousin. It would be rather a
lark to visit his ship, wouldn&#8217;t it? Not too
far off, is she, d&#8217;ye think?&#8217; he added, cocking
his eye at the vessel.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, no; not on such a day as this.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will you come if I go?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;With the greatest pleasure.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, that&#8217;s downright jolly of you, by
George. We&#8217;ll go in my cousin&#8217;s boat, and
he&#8217;ll send us back. I like the look of those
men-of-war&#8217;s men. It makes one feel safe even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to see them rowing. Ah, there goes something
to drink for the poor fellows. Upon my
word, old Keeling buttons up a kind heart
under that queer coat of his.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I presume,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that the lieutenant
will make no difficulty in consenting to carry
us in his boat. I am ignorant of the rules
which govern his service. Suppose you step
below, and arrange with him? If he may
not take us, Keeling will lend us a boat, I am
sure.&#8217;</p>

<p>Down he went full of eagerness, his
handsome face flushed with excitement. Mrs.
Radcliffe had joined two or three ladies, and
stood with them asking questions of Mr.
Cocker about the corvette and the wreck.
On glancing through the skylight presently, I
saw the lieutenant picking a piece of cold
fowl at the table, with a bottle of champagne
at his elbow. Old Keeling sat at his side, and
opposite were Colledge and Miss Temple.
The four of them were chatting briskly. I
took a peep at the boat under the gangway.
It was a treat to see the jolly English faces of
the fellows, and to hear the tongue of the old
home spoken over the side. A number of
our seamen had perched themselves on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
bulwarks and were calling questions to the
men-of-war&#8217;s-men whilst they watched them
draining the glasses which the steward had
sent down to them in a basket. From the
answers the fellows made I gathered that the
<i>Magicienne</i> was from Simon&#8217;s Bay, having been
relieved on the coast, where she had been
stationed for I will not pretend to remember
how long. Small wonder that the bronzed,
round-faced, bullet-headed, but exceedingly
gentlemanly lieutenant should have fixed a
transported eye on the sweet face and golden
hair and the violet stars of Miss Hudson after
his unendurably long frizzling months of West
African beauties.</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes he made his
appearance upon deck, followed by Keeling
and Miss Temple and Colledge, who came
sliding up to me to say that it was all right:
the lieutenant would convey us with pleasure
and bring us back: and what did I think?
Miss Temple was to be of our party.</p>

<p>&#8216;Humph!&#8217; said I; &#8216;any other ladies?&#8217;</p>

<p>He made a grimace. &#8216;No,&#8217; he responded
in a whisper; &#8216;the lieutenant suggested others;
but I could twig in Miss Temple&#8217;s face that if
others went she would remain. You know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
there&#8217;s not a woman on board that she cares
about. I rather want,&#8217; said he, returning to
his former voice, &#8216;to introduce her to my
cousin. He will be seeing my father when
he returns, and is pretty sure to talk,&#8217; said he,
giving me a wink.</p>

<p>&#8216;Does Miss Temple know that you&#8217;ve
invited me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She does, Trojan.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And how did she receive the news?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;With rapture,&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;A fig for such raptures! but I&#8217;ll go, spite
of her delight.&#8217;</p>

<p>By this time Miss Temple had made known
her intentions to her aunt. I became aware
of this circumstance by the old lady uttering
a loud shriek.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is entirely out of the question; I forbid
you to go,&#8217; she cried, with a face of agony on her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nonsense!&#8217; answered Miss Temple: she
and her aunt and old Keeling and the lieutenant
were slowly coming towards the break of the
poop, where Colledge and I waited whilst this
altercation proceeded; so everything said was
plainly to be heard by us. &#8216;It is as calm as
a river,&#8217; exclaimed the girl, sending one of her
flashing looks at the sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8216;You may be drowned; you may never
return. I will not permit it. What would
your mother think?&#8217; cried poor Mrs. Radcliffe
vehemently, pecking away with her face, and
clapping her hands to emphasise her words.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aunt, do not be ridiculous, I beg. I
shall go. It will amuse me, and I am already
very weary of the voyage. Only consider: at
this rate of sailing we may be five or six
months longer at sea. This is a little harmless,
safe distraction. Now, <i>don&#8217;t</i> be foolish,
auntie.&#8217;</p>

<p>The old lady appealed to Captain Keeling.
He was looking somewhat dubiously round the
horizon when the lieutenant broke in; then
Colledge indulged in a flourish, and though I
can&#8217;t trace the steps of it, nor recollect the
talk, somehow or other a little later on the
three of us were in the boat, a bag of letters
on a thwart, the lieutenant picking up the
yoke-lines as he seated himself, the bow-oar
thrusting off, with a vision through the open
rail of the poop of old Captain Keeling stiffly
sawing the air with his arms, in some effort,
as I took it, to console Mrs. Radcliffe, who
flourished a handkerchief to her face as
though she wept.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE &#8216;MAGICIENNE&#8217;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> corvette looked a mighty long distance
away from the low elevation of the boat&#8217;s
gunwale&mdash;almost as far as the horizon, it
seemed to my eyes, though from the height of
the deck of the Indiaman the sea-line showed
something above the bulwarks of the man-of-war.
One hardly noticed the movement in
the sea on board the <i>Countess Ida</i>, so solemn
and steady was the swing of the great fabric,
a movement stealing into one&#8217;s thoughts like
a habit, and leaving one unconscious of it;
but the heave was instantly to be felt in the
boat, and I own that I could not have believed
there was so much swell until I felt the lift of
the noiseless polished fold and marked the
soft blue volume of the water brimming to
the hot and blistered sides and green sheathing
of the Indiaman.</p>

<p>A huge lump of a ship she looked as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
were swept away from her; her masts soaring
in three spires with the flash of a vane above
the airy gossamer of the loftiest cloths; groups
of passengers watching us from the violet-tinted
shadow under the awning, heads of
seamen at the rail, or figures of them upon
the forecastle near the huge cathead that
struck a shadow of its own into the water
under it. The great bowsprit went tapering
to the delicacy of the flying-jib-boom end
marshalling the flight of white jibs; a stream
of radiance floated in the water under each
large window. Inexpressible is the effect she
produced taken along with the dwindling of
her to the impulse of our oars, with the fining
down into thinnest notes of the voices of the
people, and with the soft and still softening
sounds of her canvas lightly swaying.</p>

<p>&#8216;A grand old ship,&#8217; exclaimed the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;I had no idea she owned such a handsome
stern,&#8217; said Colledge; &#8216;quite a blaze of gilt, I
do protest, Miss Temple. How gloriously old
Keeling&#8217;s cabin-window sparkles amid the
gingerbread magnificence of decoration.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is there in the art of painting to
reproduce such a picture as that?&#8217; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Miss Temple, with her dark eyes glowing to
the mood of delight raised in her by the
beautiful spectacle. &#8216;It is like looking at an
image in a soap-bubble. What brush could
fling those silver-bluish daintinesses of tint
upon canvas, and make one see the ship
through this atmosphere filled with ocean-light?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ocean-light!&#8217; exclaimed the lieutenant,
viewing her with an air of profound admiration;
&#8216;that is the fit expression, madam.
Light at sea is different from light on shore.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;As how?&#8217; cried Colledge.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, my dear fellow, see what a reflecting
eye the ocean has,&#8217; said I; &#8216;it stares back in
glory to the glory that looks down upon it.
Mould and clay can&#8217;t do that, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True,&#8217; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray,&#8217; said I, addressing him, &#8216;when you
overhauled that hull yonder, did you meet
with anything to warrant our suspicion that
she was a rover?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I found no papers,&#8217; said he; &#8216;forward,
she is burnt into a shell. All her guns are
gone&mdash;dropped overboard, I suppose, to keep
her afloat. She has a little round-house aft,
and in it sits a man.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>&#8216;A man?&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;He sits in a musing posture,&#8217; continued
the lieutenant; &#8216;he frowns, and seems vexed.
He holds a feather pen in one hand, and
supports his head on the elbow of his left arm,
but he doesn&#8217;t write: possibly because there is
no ink and the wind seems to have blown his
paper away.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he dead?&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;Quite,&#8217; responded the lieutenant, with a
smile of enjoyment of her beauty.</p>

<p>&#8216;God bless me!&#8217; cried Colledge, staring at
the hull under the sharp of his hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is she a picaroon, think you, sir?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Impossible to say,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;there
are stands of small-arms in her cabin below,
and a sweep of &#8217;tweendecks full of piratic
bedding. She will have been crowded with
sailors, I should think, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>The six men-of-war&#8217;s men were making the
fine little cutter hum as they bent to their
oars, one hairy face showing past another, the
eyes of each man upon his blade, though now
and again one or another would steal a respectful
peep at Miss Temple. What exquisite
discipline their demeanour suggested! One
hardly needed to do more than glance at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to sound to the very depths the whole philosophy
of our naval story. How should it be
otherwise than as it is with a nation that
could be the mother of such children as those
fellows?</p>

<p>The lieutenant was very talkative, and
had a deal to say about the West Coast of
Africa and Cape Town; and he had a great
many questions to ask about home. Miss
Temple constantly directed her eyes over the
side, as though affected and even startled by
the proximity of the mighty surface. And
boundless the light blue heaving plain looked
as it went swimming to the far-off slope of
sky that it seemed to wash&mdash;the vaster, the
more enormous for the breaks of toy-like
craft upon it; for the Indiaman and the
corvette were standards to assist the mind
into some perception of the surrounding
immensity, and never to me did the heavens
seem so high nor the curve of the ocean
boundary so remote as I found them from the
low seat of the cutter, with the corvette
growing over the bow, and the Indiaman
astern dwarfed to the dimensions of a boy&#8217;s
model of a ship.</p>

<p>It was a longer pull than I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
believed, and roastingly hot, thanks to the
flaming reflection that filled the heart of the
sea, and to the motionless atmosphere, which
was scarcely to be stirred even into the
subtlest fanning of the cheek by our passage
through it. Miss Temple&#8217;s face in the shadow
of her parasol resembled some incomparable
carving in marble, and but little of vitality
was to be seen in it outside of her rich, full,
eloquent eyes, when she fell into some pause
of thought and looked away into the dim blue
distance as though she beheld a vision down
in it. The corvette appeared deserted, with
her high bulwarks topped yet with a line of
hammocks; but it was easy to see that it was
known on board the lieutenant was bringing
a lady along with others to visit the man-of-war,
for there was already a proper gangway
ladder over the side, with a grating to step
out on, though the broad-beamed craft swayed
more to the swell than the Indiaman, and so
dipped the platform that it needed a deal of
manoeuvring to save Miss Temple from wetting
her feet.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Panton, a tall, exceedingly
handsome man, with iron-grey hair and a
sun-reddened complexion, received us at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
gangway. He seemed scarcely able to believe
his eyes when Colledge called out to him. He
welcomed Miss Temple with an air of lofty
respectful dignity that would have sat well
upon some nobleman of magnificence welcoming
a royal visitor to his home. Chairs were
brought from the cabin and placed on the
quarter-deck in the shelter of the awning, along
with a little table, upon which were put some
excellent sherry, claret, and seltzer-water, and
a box of capital cigars. The look of this ship,
after the Indiaman&#8217;s encumbered decks broken
by their poop and topgallant forecastle, was a
real treat to the seafaring eye. She was flush
fore and aft: every plank was as white as a
peeled almond; the black breeches of her
artillery gave a noble, massive, imposing character
to her tall, immensely thick bulwarks;
the ratlines showed straight as thin bars of
iron in the wide spread of shrouds and topmast
rigging; the running gear was flemish-coiled;
the brass-work sparkled like burnished
gold; the snow-like cloths of the fore-course
gathered an amazing brightness from their
mere contrast with the red coat of a marine
pacing the forecastle; the sailors, in white
clothes, straw-hats, and naked feet, sprang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
softly here and there to the light chirrupings
of a pipe, or went on with the various jobs
they were about on deck and in the rigging
amid a silence that one might ask for in vain
among a crew of merchantmen. Far away
down upon the starboard beam was the Indiaman,
blue in the airy distance, with a sort of
winking of shadows upon her square and lofty
canvas, as the cloths swung in and out,
brightening and dimming.</p>

<p>Sir Edward was delighted to see his
cousin, and it seemed as if there was to be no
end to their talk, so numberless were the
questions the commander put about home,
his family, doings in London, matters political,
and so on, and so on. I had a chance, whilst
Colledge was spinning some long twister of
private interest to Sir Edward, to exchange a
few words with Miss Temple, whose behaviour
in the main might have easily led me to believe
that she was absolutely unconscious of
my presence; in fact, I shouldn&#8217;t have addressed
her then but for finding in the domestic
and personal gossip of the two cousins an
obligation of either talking or walking away.</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Countess Ida</i> looks a long distance
off, Miss Temple.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>&#8216;Farther, I think, than this ship looks
from her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That is owing to a change in the atmosphere.
We shall be having some weather
by-and-by.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not before we return, I hope.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The blue thickens yonder,&#8217; I exclaimed,
indicating that quarter of the sea where I had
noticed the depression of the horizon.</p>

<p>She gazed listlessly; her eyes then went
roaming over the ship with a sparkle in them
of the pleasure the whiteness and the brightness
and the orderliness of all that she beheld
gave her.</p>

<p>Presently Sir Edward exclaimed: &#8216;Miss
Temple, you would like to inspect this vessel,
I am sure. I wish to show Stephen my wife&#8217;s
portrait, and I want you to see it. Mr. Dugdale,
you will join us.&#8217;</p>

<p>Down we went into a very pleasant cabin,
and the captain produced a water-colour
sketch of his lady.</p>

<p>&#8216;A sweet face!&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple;
whilst Sir Edward gazed at the picture with
eyes full of the yearning heart of a sailor long
divorced from his love.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you found your charmer yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Stephen?&#8217; said he. &#8216;Any girl won your budding
affections?&#8217;</p>

<p>The youth looked at me suddenly and
turned of a deep red. I believe he would
have said no at once, and with a cocksure
face, had I not been there. Miss Temple&#8217;s
gaze rested upon him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, who is it, Stephen, eh?&#8217; exclaimed
Sir Edward with a merry laugh. &#8216;See how
he blushes, Miss Temple! a sure sign that he
has let go his anchor, though he is riding to
a long scope all the way out here. Who is it,
Steve?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, hang it, Ned, never mind; you
bother a fellow so,&#8217; answered Colledge with a
fine air of mingled irritation and confusion,
and a half-look at me that was just the same
as saying, &#8216;What an ass I am making of
myself!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Miss Temple,&#8217; exclaimed Sir Edward,
laughing heartily again, &#8216;he may possibly
have confided the lady&#8217;s name to you? Pray
satisfy my curiosity, that I may congratulate
him before we part.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am as ignorant as you are,&#8217; she replied,
with an expression of cold surprise in her
face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>I marched to a porthole to look out, that
I might conceal an irrepressible grin.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, show us the ship, will ye, Ned?&#8217;
shouted Colledge; &#8216;there&#8217;s a long pull before
us, and we&#8217;re bound to India, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>Captain Panton led the way out of the
cabin, and went in advance with Miss Temple,
pointing here and explaining there, and full
of his ship. Colledge sidled up to me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dugdale,&#8217; he exclaimed in a whisper, &#8216;do
you believe that Miss Temple will guess from
my idiotic manner just now that I&#8217;m engaged
to be married?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes; I saw her gaze sink right into
you and then go clean through you. It is
best as it is, Colledge. You may breathe
freely now.&#8217;</p>

<p>He smothered an execration, and continued
gloomy and silent for some time.
There was not very much to be seen below.
We were presently on deck; and after another
ten minutes&#8217; chat, during which Colledge
seemed to regain his spirits, the boat was
ordered alongside.</p>

<p>&#8216;It shall be my secret as well as yours,
Stephen, long before you are home from your
tiger-hunts!&#8217; exclaimed Sir Edward at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
gangway, waggishly shaking his forefinger at
his cousin.</p>

<p>We shook hands, entered the boat; the
lieutenant took his seat, the oars sparkled,
and away we went with a flourish of our hats
to the commander, who stood for some time
in the open gangway watching us.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s a trifle more swell than there was,
I fancy,&#8217; said I to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think there is,&#8217; he answered, looking
over the sea as if he thought of something
else.</p>

<p>&#8216;What a confounded quiz Ned is!&#8217; exclaimed
Colledge. &#8216;He&#8217;s rather too fond of a
laugh at other people&#8217;s expense. I think that
sort of thing a mistake myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He is a very handsome gentleman,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I&#8217;m mighty glad to have seen him,&#8217;
said Colledge. &#8216;He&#8217;s a dear good fellow,
only&mdash;&mdash; I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the trip,
Miss Temple?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thoroughly, thank you; it is a delightful
change. How strange to think of that toy
yonder as being our home for some months to
come! It is like fancying one&#8217;s self as dwelling
in a star, to see her floating out there in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
blue haze, as though she were poised in the
atmosphere.&#8217;</p>

<p>She fastened her eyes on the Indiaman as
she spoke. One saw in this that she had a
sailor&#8217;s observation for atmospheric effect.
Star-like the ship looked in the distance&mdash;a
dash of misty light in the blue haze, hovering,
as it were, above the junction of sea and sky,
where the blending of the elements was so
dim and hot that you couldn&#8217;t tell where they
met.</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t it thickening up a trifle, somehow?&#8217;
said I to the lieutenant. &#8216;Look to the right
of the wreck there&mdash;what is that appearance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you see?&#8217; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, to my fancy, it is as though there
were a dust-storm miles away yonder.&#8217;</p>

<p>He smiled, and answered: &#8216;Mere heat. One
doesn&#8217;t need many months on the West African
coast to grow used to that sort of aspects.
They suggest nothing but quinine to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What time is it?&#8217; said Colledge.</p>

<p>We pulled out our watches: it was half-past
four.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am sorry we are returning to the Indiaman,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;I should like to get away
from her for a little while; then one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
find something of freshness in her when one
returned. I am not thirsting to meet Mr.
Johnson and Mr. Emmett and Mr. Greenhew
again. Are you, Miss Temple?&#8217;</p>

<p>She slightly smiled, and said, &#8216;I wish
Bombay were as near to us as the <i>Magicienne</i>
is to the Indiaman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have an idea!&#8217; cried Colledge, whose
shining eyes, methought, seemed to suggest
the influence of the last large bumper of sherry
he had tossed down before leaving the corvette.
&#8216;Let us kill another hour by boarding the
wreck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall be very pleased to put the boat
alongside,&#8217; said the lieutenant. &#8216;What do you
say, Miss Temple?&#8217;</p>

<p>She looked at the Indiaman, and then sent
a swift glance at me, as though she would read
my face without having me know she had
peeped at it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will there be time before it falls dark?&#8217;
she answered. &#8216;I am in no hurry to return;
but I do not want to make my aunt miserable
by remaining out upon the water until after
sunset.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, we have abundance of time,&#8217; said the
lieutenant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8216;It will give us so much to talk about,&#8217;
exclaimed Colledge. &#8216;I want to see what sort of
a ship it was that frightened us so abominably
the other day.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you say, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217; said
Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am thinking of the lonely sentinel this
gentleman was telling us about as we came
along,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, one peep! one peep at him, just one
peep!&#8217; cried Colledge: &#8216;<i>don&#8217;t</i> let us go back
to the Indiaman too soon. At this rate,&#8217; he
added, turning up his slightly flushed face to
the sky, &#8216;we may have another six months of
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>The lieutenant laughed, and, anxious to
please him, as I supposed, quietly pulled a
yoke-line and swept the boat&#8217;s head fair for
the hull. His making nothing of the appearance
I had called his attention to was reassuring.
I should have thought nothing of
it either but for the indent in the horizon that
morning, and the recollection that grew out of
it, as I have told you. But then old Keeling
had let us start from his ship without a hint,
and Sir Edward had uttered no caution, though,
to be sure, in those days the barometer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
not the shaper of marine speculations it has
since become; and the silence of these two
skippers, and the smile and careless rejoinder
of the lieutenant, should have been amply
satisfying. Nevertheless, there was no question
but that the light swell heaving out of the
north-west was sensibly gaining in volume and
speed, and that it was the mere respiration
of the ocean I could by no means persuade
myself, though it might signify nothing.</p>

<p>Colledge grew somewhat frolicsome; indeed,
I seemed to find an artificiality in his
spirits, as though he would clear Miss Temple&#8217;s
memory of Captain Panton&#8217;s <i>badinage</i> by
laughter and jokes. The lieutenant fell in
with his humour, said some comical things,
and told one or two lively anecdotes of the
blacks of that part of the coast the corvette
was fresh from. The men-of-war&#8217;s men pulled
steadily, and the keen stem of the cutter
sheared through the oil-smooth surface with
a noise as of the ripping of satin; but now
and again she would swing down into a hollow
that put the low sides of the wreck out of
sight, whilst, as we approached, I noticed that
the hull was leaning from side to side in a
swing which did not need to greatly increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to put the lieutenant to his trumps to get Miss
Temple aboard.</p>

<p>But by this time the girl was showing
some vivacity, smiling at the lieutenant&#8217;s jokes,
laughing lightly in her clear, rich, trembling
tones at Colledge&#8217;s remarks. It seemed to me
as if her previous quietude had produced a
resolution which she was now acting up to.
She was apparently eager to inspect the wreck,
and said that such an adventure would make
a heroine of her at home when she came to
tell the story of it.</p>

<p>It was a long, dragging pull over that
heaving, breathless sea, and through that
sweltering afternoon, with its sky of the complexion
of brass about the zenith. The three
craft, as they lay, formed a right-angled triangle,
the apex, to call it so, being the derelict,
and the getting to her involved a longer
stretching of the Jacks&#8217; backs than, as I
suspected, the lieutenant had calculated on.
The sweat poured from the men&#8217;s brows, and
their faces were like purple rags under their
straw hats as they swung with the precision
and the monotony of the tick of a clock over
the looms of their oars.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s rather unsteady, isn&#8217;t she?&#8217; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Colledge as we approached the
hulk.</p>

<p>&#8216;So much the better,&#8217; said the lieutenant;
&#8216;her bulwarks are gone, and every dip inclines
her bare deck as a platform for a jump.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She may be sinking,&#8217; cried Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dry as a bone, madam, I assure you,&#8217;
said the officer. &#8216;I looked into her hold, and
there&#8217;s scarce more water than would serve to
drown a rat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I see her name in long white letters
under her counter,&#8217; I exclaimed. &#8216;Can you
read it, Colledge?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Aspirante</i>,&#8217; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>We now fell silent, with our eyes upon
the hull, whilst the officer man&#339;uvred with
the yoke-lines to run the cutter handsomely
alongside. A single chime from a bell came
thrilling with a soft silver note through the
hushed air. Miss Temple started, and the
officer grinned into Colledge&#8217;s face, but nothing
was said. She was a very clean wreck. Her
foremast stood stoutly supported by the
shrouds; but the braces of the foreyard were
slack, and the swing of the spar, upon which
the canvas lay rolled in awkward heaps,
roughly secured by lines, as though the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of hands wild with hurry, somehow imparted
a strange, forlorn, most melancholy character
to the nakedness of that solitary mast. She
showed no guns; her decks appeared to have
been swept; the rise of her in the water
proved that her people must have jettisoned
a deal of whatever they were able to come
at; her wheel was gone, and her rudder
slowly swayed to every heave. There were a
few ropes&#8217; ends over her side, the hacked
remains of standing-rigging; but the water
brimmed clear of wreckage to her channels.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oars!&#8217; cried the lieutenant. The bowman
sprang erect; and in a few moments we
were floating alongside, soaring and falling
against the black run of her, with the deck
gaping through the length of smashed bulwark
to the level of our heads when we stood
up, each time she came lazily rolling over to
us. The clear chime of the bell rang out
again.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; cried Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;The ship&#8217;s bell,&#8217; said the lieutenant; &#8216;it
has got jammed as it hangs, and the tongue
strikes the side when the heave is a little
sharper than usual.&#8217;</p>

<p>He followed this on with certain directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to the men. Two of them, watching their
chance, sprang on to the slope of the deck,
and then went hoisting up away from us as
the hull swayed wearily to starboard. &#8216;Stand
by now!&#8217; bawled the lieutenant. &#8216;Miss
Temple, let me assist you on to this thwart.&#8217;
She leapt upon it with something of defiance
in her manner, and the officer, grasping her
elbow, supported her. I thought Colledge
looked a little uneasy and pale. We waited;
but an opportunity was some time in coming.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Colledge,&#8217; said the lieutenant, &#8216;be
kind enough to take my place and support
the lady.&#8217; He jumped lightly into the main-chains,
and was on deck in a jiffy. &#8216;Haul
her in close, men. Now, Miss Temple. Catch
hold of my hand and of this sailor&#8217;s when I
say so.&#8217;</p>

<p>Up swung the boat; the girl extended
her hands, which were instantly grasped.
&#8216;Jump, madam!&#8217; and she went in a graceful
bound from the thwart to the deck.</p>

<p>I watched till a heave brought me on a
line with the chains into which I jumped.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, Mr. Colledge!&#8217; called out the lieutenant.
He hung in the wind, and I thought
he would refuse to leave the boat; but Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Temple with her face slightly flushed stood
watching as though waiting for him, her noble
figure swaying with a marvellous careless
grace upon the floating slopes of the planks;
and this started him. He got on to a thwart,
where he was supported by a sailor till a
chance offered for his hands to be gripped,
and then he was hauled on to the hull; but
he came perilously near to going overboard,
for the sudden sinking away of the cutter
from under him paralysed his effort to jump,
and he swung against the side of the wreck in
the grasp of the lieutenant and a seaman, who
dragged him up just in time to save his legs
from being ground by the soaring of the boat.
The two sailors then jumped into the cutter,
which shoved off, and lay rising and falling
upon the quarter to the scope of her painter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>ADRIFT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a small deck-house standing abaft
the jagged ends of the stump of the mainmast,
a low-pitched, somewhat narrow, and rather
long structure, with a door facing the wheel,
or where the wheel had stood, and a couple of
small windows on either hand, the glass of
which was entirely gone.</p>

<p>&#8216;The lonely watchman of this wreck is still
at home, doubtless waiting to receive us,&#8217; said
the lieutenant, pointing to the little building.
&#8216;Shall we pay him a visit?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes; let us see everything that there
may be to look at,&#8217; answered Colledge, who
had not yet recovered his breath, but who was
working hard, I could see, to regain his late
air of vivacity, though he was pale, and shot
several uneasy glances around him as he
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather not look,&#8217; said Miss
Temple; &#8216;it will make me dream.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8216;You will have nothing to talk about, then,&#8217;
said Colledge.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is the most natural object in the world,&#8217;
exclaimed the lieutenant; &#8216;if he could be
stuffed, preserving the posture he is in, and
exhibited in London, thousands would assemble
to view him.&#8217;</p>

<p>I left them to persuade Miss Temple if
they could, and walking aft, opened the door,
and peeped in. It was just a plain, immensely
strong, roughly furnished deck erection, with
a small hatch close against the entrance, conducting,
as I supposed, to the cabin beneath.
On either side went a row of lockers; in the
centre was a short narrow table, supported by
stanchions; and at this table sat the figure of
a man. He was in an attitude of writing; his
right hand grasped a long feather pen; his left
elbow was on the table, and his cheek was
supported by his hand. He was dressed in
white jean breeches, the ends of which were
stuffed into a pair of yellow leather half-boots.
There was a large belt round his waist, clasped
by some ornament resembling a two-headed
eagle, of a shining metal, probably silver.
His shirt was a pale red flannel, over which
was a jacket cut in the Spanish fashion; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hair was long, and flowed in black ringlets
upon his back. His hat was a large sombrero,
and I had to walk abreast of him to see his
face. I was prepared to witness a ghastly
sight. Instead, I beheld a countenance of
singular beauty. It was as if the hand of
death had moulded some faultless human
countenance out of white wax. The lids of
the eyes drooped, and the gaze seemed rooted
upon the table, as though the man lay rapt
and motionless in some sweet and perfect
dream. His small moustache was like a touch
of delicate pencilling. He looked to have
been a person of some three or four and
twenty years of age.</p>

<p>As I stood surveying the figure, the interior
was shadowed. Miss Temple and the others
stood in the doorway. The lieutenant and
Colledge entered; the girl would not approach.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, Miss Temple,&#8217; said I, &#8216;is the handsomest
man I have ever seen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can he be dead?&#8217; exclaimed Colledge in
a subdued voice of awe.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll never be deader,&#8217; said the lieutenant,
peering curiously into the face of the corpse.
&#8216;<i>Handsome</i>, do you consider him, sir? Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
we all have our tastes, to be sure. He looks
like a woman masquerading.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who was he, I wonder?&#8217; asked Miss
Temple in a low tone, standing in a half-shrinking
attitude at the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very hard to say,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Too young
for the captain, I should think. Probably the
mate.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A pirate, anyway,&#8217; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hark!&#8217; cried Miss Temple; &#8216;this ship is
tolling his knell.&#8217;</p>

<p>The mellow chime floated past the ear.
The effect was extraordinary, so clear was
the note as it rang through the soft sounds
of the weltering waters; so ghostly, wild,
and unreal, too, the character it gathered
from the presence of that silent, stirless
penman.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, we&#8217;ve seen enough of him, I think,&#8217;
exclaimed Colledge.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall we bury him?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no, sir,&#8217; exclaimed the lieutenant;
&#8216;this sheer hulk is his coffin. Leave the dead
to bury their dead. Now for a glimpse of the
cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple entered with some reluctance;
the lieutenant handed her through the hatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
down the short ladder, and Colledge and I
followed. We found ourselves in a moderately-sized
state-room of the width of the little
vessel, with bulkheads at either end, each containing
a couple of cabins. There was a
small skylight overhead, all the glass of it
shattered, but light enough fell through to
enable us to see easily. Colledge had plucked
up heart, and now bustled about somewhat
manfully, opening the cabin doors, starting as
if he saw horrible sights, cracking jokes as in
the boat, and calling to Miss Temple to look
here and look there, and so on.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hallo!&#8217; cried the lieutenant, putting his
head into one of the cabins at the fore-end of
the state-room; &#8216;I missed this room when I
overhauled her. What have we here? A
pantry is it, or a larder?&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked over his shoulder, and by the faint
light sifting through the bull&#8217;s-eye in the deck,
made out the contents of what was apparently
a storeroom. There were several shelves containing
crockery, cheeses, hams, and other
articles of food. Under the lower shelf, heaped
upon the deck, were stowed several dozens of
bottles in straw.</p>

<p>&#8216;The corsairs,&#8217; said the lieutenant, &#8216;will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
always be memorable for the excellence of
their tipple. What is this, now?&#8217;</p>

<p>He picked up a bottle, knocked off the
head, and taking a little tin drinking-vessel
from a shelf, half filled it, then smelled, and
tasted.</p>

<p>&#8216;An exquisite Burgundy,&#8217; he cried. &#8216;Try
it, Mr. Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was indeed a very choice sound wine.
The lieutenant half filled a pannikin for
Colledge, who emptied it with a sigh of enjoyment.
&#8216;What would my father give for such
stuff as this!&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>The lieutenant found a wine-glass, which
he carefully cleansed with the liquor, and then
filling it, he asked Miss Temple to drink to
the confusion of all pirates. She laughed, and
declined.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, you must sip it, if you please,&#8217; cried
Colledge, &#8216;if only to heighten the romance of
this adventure. Think of the additional colour
your story will get out of this incident of
drinking perdition to the corsairs in wine of
their own!&#8217;</p>

<p>She was about to answer, when the hull
rolled heavily. The lieutenant slipped; the
wine-glass fell to the deck, and was shivered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Colledge, grasping me to steady himself, threw
me off my balance, and the pair of us went
rolling to the bottles. The young fellow
scrambled on to his legs with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe this vessel is tipsy,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you mark the increase in the weight
of the swell?&#8217; I exclaimed as I regained my
legs.</p>

<p>The roll of the vessel the other way had
been severe, and now she was dipping her
sides regularly with an oscillation extravagant
enough to render standing very inconvenient.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must be off, I think,&#8217; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Miss Temple hasn&#8217;t drunk confusion to
the pirates,&#8217; exclaimed Colledge with the persistency
of brains flushed with wine.</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather not do so,&#8217; she answered,
her fine face looking curiously pale in that
dull light, whilst she glanced restlessly towards
the state cabin. She pulled out a little watch.
&#8216;It is certainly time to return to the Indiaman,&#8217;
she added.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, but don&#8217;t let us leave all this noble
drink to go down to the bottom of the sea,&#8217;
cried Colledge. &#8216;Is there nothing that we can
pack some of the bottles in? If we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
only manage to get away with a couple of
dozen&mdash;twelve for ourselves and twelve for
my cousin?&#8217;&mdash;and with red face and bright
eyes he went staggering with the heave of the
hull to the shelves and stood holding on, looking
about him.</p>

<p>&#8216;It might be managed, I think,&#8217; said the
lieutenant, who seemed all anxiety to oblige
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish to be gone,&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple
with a strong hint of the imperiousness that
had been familiar to me in the Indiaman in the
air with which she looked at and addressed
the lieutenant. &#8216;What is the meaning of this
increased rolling? I shall not be able to enter
the boat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No fear of that, madam,&#8217; answered the
lieutenant; &#8216;a dismasted egg-shell like this
will roll to the weakest heave. A trifle more
swell has certainly set in, but it is nothing.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was not so sure of that. What he was
pleased to describe as a trifling increase was to
my mind, and very distinctly too, a heightening
and broadening of the undulations, of which
the significance was rendered strong by the
suddenness of the thing. It meant wind close
at hand, I could swear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8216;I&#8217;ll go on deck and see how things are,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Take me with you, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; exclaimed
Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will suffer me to assist you?&#8217; said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I say, <i>don&#8217;t</i> leave all this wine here,&#8217;
cried Colledge. &#8216;Mr.&mdash;I mean Lieutenant&mdash;upon
my word, I must apologise for not having
asked your name&mdash;can&#8217;t we manage to find
some old basket&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is that down in the corner there,
Mr. Colledge?&#8217; said the lieutenant, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, take me on deck, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;
exclaimed Miss Temple haughtily and with
temper, and she came to my side and passed
her arm through mine.</p>

<p>The swaying of the light hull without top-hamper
to steady her so hindered one&#8217;s movements
by the staggering lurches it flung one
into, that it cost me no small effort to steer a
fair course with Miss Temple hanging to me,
to the cabin steps. I helped her up the ladder,
and felt in her arm the shudder that swept
through her as she sent a single swift glance
at the dead figure at the table.</p>

<p>The moment I emerged I cried out: &#8216;My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
God! see there! Why, if we are not
quick&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; And putting my head into the
doorway again, I roared down the hatch:
&#8216;For heaven&#8217;s sake, come on deck, or we shall
lose both ships!&#8217;</p>

<p>Indeed, all away in the north-west was
a white blankness of vapour bearing right
down upon the hull, with a long and heavy
swell rolling out of it, the heads of which as
they came washing from under the base of the
thickness were dark with wind. The sky
overhead was of a sort of watery ashen colour,
going down to the eastern sea-line in a weak,
dim blue, so obscure with the complexion of
the approaching vaporous mass that the
corvette on the left hand and the Indiaman
on the right appeared as little more than pallid
smudges, with a kind of looming out of their
dull, distorted proportions that made them
show as though they hung upon the very verge
of the ocean. I told Miss Temple to hold to
the side of the deck-house to steady herself,
and rushed to the quarter. The cutter lay
there to the scope of her painter, rising and
falling in a manner bewildering to see to one
who knew that she had to be entered from
these perilously sloping decks. The moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
my head was seen, one of the sailors bawled
out: &#8216;The Indiaman&#8217;s fired two guns, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why the deuce,&#8217; I shouted in a passion,
&#8216;didn&#8217;t one of you jump aboard to report
what was coming? Haul alongside, for God&#8217;s
sake.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this moment the lieutenant appeared,
followed by Colledge. He took one look, and
came in a bound to the sheer edge of the deck,
where the remains of the line of crushed bulwarks
stood like fangs. &#8216;Lively now!&#8217; he
cried; &#8216;hand over hand with it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall be smothered out of sight in a
few minutes,&#8217; I exclaimed; &#8216;shall we be acting
wisely in quitting this hull? We may lose
both ships in that weather there, and what will
there be to do then?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t frighten the lady, sir,&#8217; he answered,
turning upon me with a frown. &#8216;Miss Temple,
there is nothing to be alarmed at. We shall
get you into the boat simply enough, and the
vapour will speedily clear. I know these
waters.&#8217;</p>

<p>Colledge stood gazing round him, looking
horribly frightened. The boat was dragged
alongside: one moment she was above the
level of the naked edge of the deck; the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
she was sliding away out of sight into the
hollow, with the wreck rolling heavily off from
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, Miss Temple,&#8217; cried the lieutenant.
&#8216;Help me to steady the lady, Mr. Dugdale.
Stand by, two of you men there, to receive
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple set her lips, and her eyes were
on fire with anger and fear. &#8216;I shall not be
able to enter that boat,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, madam, be persuaded,&#8217; cried the
lieutenant, speaking irritably out of his
clear perception of the danger of delay
and of the peril of passing her into the
cutter. &#8216;Mr. Dugdale, take Miss Temple&#8217;s
arm.&#8217;</p>

<p>She shrank back, with a firmer grip of the
deck-house, against which she had set her
shoulder to steady herself. &#8216;You will kill
me!&#8217; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; exclaimed the lieutenant
wildly, &#8216;for God&#8217;s sake, jump into the boat,
that Miss Temple may see how easily it is to
be done. I must be the last to leave.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let Mr. Colledge jump first,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I
may probably be more useful to you and the
lady than he.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8216;Jump, Mr. Colledge!&#8217; cried the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The young fellow went to the edge of the
deck. &#8216;I shall break my neck,&#8217; he shouted;
&#8216;I shall fall into the sea; I shall be drowned.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir! no, sir!&#8217; roared one of the
seamen; &#8216;jump as the boat lifts; we&#8217;ll catch
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>Now!</i>&#8217; cried the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Colledge sprang; down sank the boat out
of sight; then up she soared again with Colledge
safe in the embrace of one of the most
powerful of the sailors.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here it comes!&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>As the words left my lips, the wind, with
a long fierce howl, swept over the deck of the
hull, and a moment later the fog was boiling
all about us. It was like a mighty burst of
steam; and in a breath the ocean vanished, and
there was nothing to see but the wool-white
blankness and a space of thirty or forty feet
of water beyond the wreck. All on a sudden,
the lieutenant, who had gone to the edge of
the deck, perhaps to see how it was with
Colledge, or to bawl some further directions
to the seamen, staggered to a deep and swinging
heel of the hull and went overboard. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
happened in a second. My instant impression
was that he had jumped for the boat;
but I knew better when I heard the men
roaring out.</p>

<p>&#8216;For heaven&#8217;s sake, Miss Temple,&#8217; I cried,
&#8216;keep a firm hold, and do not attempt to stir,
or the angle of the decks will certainly rush
you over the side.&#8217;</p>

<p>So saying, I staggered to the quarter
where there were some eight or ten feet of
bulwarks still standing, and looked over.
The men had let go the painter of their boat,
and were shouting instructions to one another
as some of them flung their oars over into the
rowlocks, whilst others overhung the gunwale
eagerly with pale faces and looks of consternation
and dread, searching the round
volumes of the swell, which the wind was
now whipping into yeast, for any signs of
their officer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Keep alongside!&#8217; I bellowed; &#8216;he will
rise near.&#8217;</p>

<p>But the fellows were distracted, unnerved,
and there was nobody to give them orders.
The howling of the wind, the sudden leaping
down upon them of this blindness of white
vapour, the violent upheavals and sinkings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the cutter upon the run of the liquid hills,
heavily increased the distraction raised in
them by their lieutenant&#8217;s disappearance.
They had three oars out, possessed, I suppose,
by some mad fancy of merely paddling whilst
they stared round the water; and even whilst
I watched them, and whilst I yelled to them
to get their six oars over, and to pull for
their lives to alongside the wreck, the boat,
yielding to the full weight of the blast and to
the long irresistible heavings of the swell,
faded out of sight in the flying thickness; and
ere I could fully realise what had occurred,
the narrow space of foam-freckled pouring
waters showed blank to where the flying
vapour seemed to hang like a wall of white
smoke.</p>

<p>I continued to stare, occasionally bringing
my eyes away from the spot where the boat
had vanished to the water alongside; but the
lieutenant had sunk. There could be no
doubt that the poor fellow on rising from his
first dive had struck the bends of the hull as
she rolled heavily over to the trough where
he had vanished, and so had been drowned,
struck down again into the depths, to rise no
more. I could not realise the truth. I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
as if I had fallen crazy, and was imagining
dreadful horrors. It was but a minute or
two before that he had turned to me with a
frown&mdash;it was but a little while before that
he was full of jokes and laughter in the cabin&mdash;and
now he lay a dead man, sinking and
yet sinking under our heaving and plunging
keel, dead as the figure yonder in that little
cabin, of whom he had spoken jestingly so
lately that the words and tone of his voice
were still in my ear!</p>

<p>&#8216;Where is the boat, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>I turned slowly round and looked at the
girl with an air of stupefaction, then stared
again into the blankness, and with shuddering
heart swept my eyes over the water alongside,
brimming in humpbacked rounds to the very
line of the deck, and sweeping away into the
near thickness with a spitting and seething
and flashing of foam off each long slant to the
fierce shrill smiting of the wind.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has the boat left us, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>With a desperate effort I rallied myself,
and watching for my chances betwixt the wild
slopings of the deck, I reached the deck-house,
and held on by the girl&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8216;The boat has been blown away. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
men fell imbecile, I do believe, when they
saw their officer drop overboard. What
madmen to let go the painter, to man&#339;uvre
with three oars in a heavy cutter in the teeth
of such a wind as this, and on the top of that
swell!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Did they recover the lieutenant?&#8217; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; she shrieked, &#8216;do you
tell me he is drowned?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;he is drowned,&#8217; I answered,
scarce able to articulate for the sudden fit of
horror that came upon me again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Drowned!&#8217; she exclaimed. &#8216;Oh no&mdash;not
so suddenly! He may be struggling close
against the vessel now&#8217;&mdash;she moved as if to
go to the side to look. I grasped her arm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not stir,&#8217; I cried; &#8216;the slope of the
deck will carry you overboard. It is all open
to the water abreast of us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Shocking! It is unendurable! Drowned
so swiftly! And the boat&mdash;the boat, Mr.
Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>The cruel distress in her voice, the anguish
of mind expressed in her parted lips, her
heaving breast, her strained, brilliant, wide-open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
staring looks about her, obliged me to
recollect myself by forcing me to understand
my obligations as a man.</p>

<p>&#8216;Miss Temple, this fog may prove but a
passing thickness. There is a clear sky over
it, and when the vapour settles away, the sea
will open to its confines. The Indiaman knows
we are here. We were watched, too, from
the corvette, no doubt, and she must regain
her boat besides. The cutter is a powerful
little fabric, and there is nothing as yet in this
weather or in that sea to hurt her. It is a
hard experience for you; but it will prove a
brief one only, I am sure. Let me assist you
to a seat in this deck-house. Your having to
hold on here is fatiguing and dangerous.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I could not enter whilst that man is there,&#8217;
she exclaimed. &#8216;Oh, hark to that bell!&#8217; she
cried hysterically; &#8216;it is tolling for <i>us</i> now!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You must be sheltered,&#8217; I exclaimed;
&#8216;and that body must come out of it. Will
you sit on the deck? You will be safer so.&#8217;</p>

<p>She sank down; and to still further secure
her, I went sliding and clawing like a monkey
to the quarter, where, with my knife, I severed
an end of rope&mdash;a piece of gear belayed to a
pin&mdash;with which I returned to her side. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
passed the line round her waist, and firmly
attached the ends to one of several iron uprights
which supported the structure; and
begging her to compose her mind, and not to
doubt of our deliverance within the next two
or three hours, I entered the little building.</p>

<p>It was a loathsome job; but the girl must
be sheltered, and it was not to be borne that
she should have such a companion as that
corpse, when there was the great graveyard
of the sea within an easy drag to receive the
body. Yet I must own to coming to a stand
with a long look at the silent figure before I
could muster up stomach enough to lay hands
upon him. Indeed, as I now fixed my eyes
on the body, I wondered whether he could be
really dead, so startlingly lifelike was his posture,
so pensive his air, so vital the aspect of
him to the minutest feature, down to the pen
betwixt his fingers, and the reposeful position
of his small wax-white hand upon the table.
How could I tell but that he might be in some
sort of trance, and that my heaving him overboard
would be the same as murdering him?
However, after a spell of staring, I shook off
these alarms and conjectures, and grasping
him by the arm, got him upon the deck; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
presently I had him abreast of that part of the
brig&#8217;s side where the bulwarks were gone;
and trembling as violently as though I were
about to drown a living being, I waited for a
roll of the hull, then gave the body a heave,
and away it went, striking the swell in a diving
attitude, and floating off and down into it, as
if it swam.</p>

<p>This done, I crept back to Miss Temple
and squatted beside her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wind blew hard, and the vapour swept
past in a horizontal pouring, masses of it
coming on a sudden in a blinding thickness
till you could not see half the wreck&#8217;s length;
then the silver-tinted volumes would brighten
for a breath or two, and show the steel-coloured
sea heaving its freckled and foamless
folds into the vaporous faintness a few hundred
feet off; then the mist would boil down and
over us once more until it was like being in a
room filled with steam.</p>

<p>&#8216;The cabin is empty,&#8217; said I&mdash;the girl being
on the port side, I had taken care to drag the
body to starboard&mdash;&#8216;there are seats, and you
will be sheltered there. This is damping
stuff.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not yet,&#8217; she answered. &#8216;I am as safe
here. I hate the thought of having anything
to screen the sea from me. I want to look&mdash;at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
any moment the Indiaman or the man-of-war
may come close to us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Be it so,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Heavens, how rapidly
has all this happened! One of the cutter&#8217;s
men shouted to me that the Indiaman had
fired two guns. Why did they not report
this to us? Did they believe the swell would
not let them get aboard? They saw&mdash;of
course they saw&mdash;this fog bearing down; why
did not the madmen let us know of it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What will my aunt think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, she will be in a terrible fright. But
it will not last. We shall be picked up presently.
I would rather be here than in the
cutter. If they are wise, they will ride to
their oars; if they row or allow the wind and
seas to drive them, they are bound to lose
both ships, the night being at hand; and then
God help them!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it was an evil moment,&#8217; she cried,
&#8216;when we sighted the corvette!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was an evil moment,&#8217; I exclaimed bitterly
and wrathfully, &#8216;when Mr. Colledge,
who had undoubtedly taken too much wine
on board the <i>Magicienne</i>, suggested that we
should kill an hour on this hull. Where,&#8217; I
cried passionately, &#8216;could the unhappy lieutenant&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wits have been? He laughed at me
for indicating the appearance I witnessed in
the north-west. Was there nothing in the
weight of this swell to convince him that
there must be mischief not far off?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What will my aunt think?&#8217; she repeated,
as though she scarcely heeded my words,
whilst she brought her hands, brilliant with
rings, together and stared into the thickness
with her eyes on fire with fear and amazement
and the score of wild emotions which
filled her.</p>

<p>Though I held my peace on the subject,
the wind, that was blowing with the spite of
an ugly squall, was exciting an alarm in me
that rose above all other considerations of our
situation. The hatches lay open and there
was nothing to be seen of their covers about
the decks. If this weather continued, a high
sea must presently follow, in which case there
could be nothing to save the wreck from filling
and foundering. The lieutenant had
assured us that she was dry; but it was
certain that she had been badly wrenched by
the lightning stroke that had dismasted and
apparently set her on fire forward, and by the
furious gale that had chased her afterwards;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and though she may have been tight when
the lieutenant overhauled her, this constant
working in the strong swell might at any instant
cause her to start a butt or open a seam,
and then what should I be able to do? Both
pumps were smashed level to the deck; there
was no boat; there was nothing discoverable
fore and aft which I could launch and secure
my companion and myself to. It was with
inexpressible anxiety, therefore, that I would
send my gaze from time to time to windward,
in the hope of observing a thinning in the
thickness there, or any the faintest imaginable
sign to elate me with the belief that the worst
of the fog was on us, that we were now feeling
the worst of the wind, and that the ocean
would be clearing soon.</p>

<p>The time passed. I looked at my watch
after we had been sitting a little, and found it
six o&#8217;clock. The sun would be setting in
something more than an hour, and a bitter
black night was bound to follow if the vapour
had not cleared when daylight ended. There
was now a smart sea running, but the swell
had flattened something, I thought. The hull
was horribly frisky, leaning at desperate
angles from side to side, and often recovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
herself with a jerk that must have flung us to
the deck had we not been seated. But she
was extraordinarily light, and floated very
tall, and though there would sometimes come
a blow of salt water against the bow that
flashed across the deck in a mass of foam and
green crystals, yet she soared so nimbly to the
height of every surge that she took in amazingly
little water. Indeed, it was not long
before I felt myself infinitely comforted by her
behaviour, convinced that it would have to
breeze up with much more spite than the
wind now had to put us in jeopardy from a
filling hold.</p>

<p>Shortly before the hour of sundown, I
induced Miss Temple to occupy the deck-house.
She entered with a great deal of
reluctance, and seated herself in a corner that
was the furthest away from where the body
had been. It had not been very easy to converse
outside. The ceaseless roaring and
washing noises of the water, with the alarming
thumps and leapings of froth at the bow, and
the sounds of the rushing wind sweeping in
gusty cries over the mutilated rails of the
hull as she was hove up full into it, and then
sinking into a sort of humming moaning as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the wreck drove down the liquid acclivity
into the swift comparative stillness of the
trough: all this was distracting and terrifying,
and speech had been difficult. But the interior
of the deck-house was a shelter to the
ear and voice. I seated myself opposite the
girl, giving her as wide, respectful a berth as
the narrow cabin permitted. The shadow of
the evening lay already sullen in the white
mist that seemed to boil upon the wind, though
at that hour it was not so thick but that the
gaze might be able to penetrate a distance of
a quarter of a mile. Miss Temple was deadly
pale. Even her lips had lost their delicate
rosy tint, and sat blanched in their compression.
Her eyes looked preternaturally large,
and there was an expression of passionate
desperation in them, as one might figure of
some proud, high-spirited creature driven at
bay, and rounding upon the pursuer with a
gaze charged with despair and wrath and the
misery of some heart-breaking resolution.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe I shall go mad,&#8217; she said, &#8216;if
this fog does not cease. I feel as though I
were now insane, and that what we are suffering
is the imagination of madness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is a frightful time of suspense,&#8217; I answered;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
&#8216;we must have patience: there is no
other medicine for this sort of affliction.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I could stab myself,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;for
being in this position. There is the Indiaman
close at hand; I see her saloon cheerful with
lamplight, the tables glittering, the passengers
seated, talking and laughing, without a
thought of us by this time.&#8217; I shook my
head. She continued: &#8216;I think of the security,
the comfort of that ship, which I never
once reflected on when in her. And now
contrast this!&#8217;</p>

<p>She rolled her wonderful eyes over the
narrow compartment in a shuddering way
that was eloquent with abhorrence.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why am I here? It is my own fault. I
could stab myself for my folly.&#8217;</p>

<p>It made one think of some beautiful wild
creature newly caged to watch her.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is bad enough,&#8217; said I; &#8216;but it might
be much worse. Think of yourself in that
open boat&mdash;on this high sea, and amidst this
blinding vapour: no water, no food, the
blackness of the night coming down, and a
thousand leagues of ocean all around you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is not the cutter safer than this horrible
wreck?&#8217; she cried. &#8216;If the morning exposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the ships to the people in her, they can row;
but what can we do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If the morning exposes the ships,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;they&#8217;ll see us, and very joyfully attempt to
fetch us&mdash;that is to sail to us.&#8217;</p>

<p>She turned to look through a window the
glass of which was gone, and through which
the wind was shrilling as though it blew into
a cylinder. It was fast darkening. In these
latitudes twilight is brief, and in such weather
as this there would be none. It was little
more now than sombre blank greyness outside,
with a sight of the steel-coloured swell,
over whose humps the seas were rushing in
foam, shouldering and vanishing into the
thickness. But there was no increase in the
wind, and the run of the surge did not gain
in weight.</p>

<p>I watched the girl while she looked through
the window. It is not in language to convey
the tragic irony that was put into our situation
by her sparkling holiday attire. Her
dress was of some white material, of a silken
or lustrous nature, that most perfectly fitted
the beauties of her person. Her hat was
some rich combination of richly plumed
straw. She had removed her gloves on descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
into the cabin of the hull when we
boarded her, and many rings of splendour
and value flashed on her fingers in a very
armour of jewels and gold. There were gems
in her ears, and a heavy chain of gold round
her neck, terminating in a whole cluster of
trinkets at her girdle, in which was sheathed
a watch of the size of her thumb-nail. Think
of this glittering figure, this stately, most perfect
shape of womanhood in the gloom of the
strong, rude interior of the deck-house, with
its few rough details of fittings in the shape
of a table and lockers, nothing to see through
the window but the rough deck spreading
naked to its splinters of bulwark, with the
angry foam of waters beyond, and a near sky
of fast blackening vapour!</p>

<p>&#8216;What are we to do?&#8217; she exclaimed,
resuming her former attitude and fixing her
large desperate eyes upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must wait,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You have been a sailor, Mr. Dugdale;
tell me what you think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, first of all, we must be prepared
to spend the night on this wreck&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; She
flashed her hands to her face and held them
there, and I waited for her to look at me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
again. &#8216;This weather,&#8217; I proceeded, &#8216;is not
likely to last very long. The dawn will probably
exhibit a clear sky. If the ships are
not in sight&#8217;&mdash;she drew in her breath with an
hysterical &#8216;Oh&#8217;&mdash;&#8216;they will still have the
bearings of the wreck, and search for us.
Were there but a single vessel to hunt after
the hull, we might still feel perfectly safe;
but there are two, and one of them is an
English man-of-war.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But will Sir Edward Panton know that
we are here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No doubt. He or others will have seen
the cutter deviate for the wreck instead of
pulling for the Indiaman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But they may think we are in the boat;
and if she is not recovered, they will search
for her, and not trouble themselves about the
wreck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We must be hopeful, and we must be
patient,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>It was now rapidly growing dark. The
white waters showed ghastly over the edge of
the bare deck to each convulsive jerking roll
of the hull, and my companion&#8217;s white face
was little more than a glimmer in the gloom
of the corner in which she sat. The thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the long black hours which lay before us
was intolerable. I looked about me for a
lamp, but there was nothing of the kind, nor
hook nor bracket to prove that a lamp or
lantern was ever used in this small abode. I
told Miss Temple that I would go below and
search for something wherewith to make a
light.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will you be long?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll make haste,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, if you please, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>I had in my pocket the old-fashioned arrangement
of tinder-box and sulphur matches,
being, indeed, too confirmed a smoker to
stir very far without that convenience. The
mere descent of the steps was a horrible
labour, owing to the extravagant leaps and
rolls of the mere shell of wreck, and my progress
was scarcely more than inch by inch,
forced to hold on as I was with the tenacity
of the grip of a parrot&#8217;s beak. The straining
noises in the cabin might have easily led me
to suppose that the hull was going to pieces.
Every blow of the sea trembled through her
down here as though the fabric forward were
breaking up, and I recollect swinging by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
stanchion for some minute or two, overwhelmed
with the consternation excited in
me by the sounds, and by a sudden recollection
of the lieutenant&#8217;s words that the brig
in her forecastle had been burnt out. But I
had promised Miss Temple to be speedy; and
the thought of her sitting lonely above in
terror and despair brought my mind back to
its bearings.</p>

<p>It was almost pitch-dark, but remembering
the situation of the pantry in which the
lieutenant had cracked the bottle of wine, I
dropped on my hands and knees, not daring
to trust my feet, and crawled towards it.
When I guessed by groping that I was near
the door, I kindled a match and entered the
pantry; and after consuming about half-a-dozen
matches, I met with a tin box that was
full of long wax candles, which looked to me
very much like a sample of booty, as it was
scarcely to be supposed that a vessel of the
class of the <i>Aspirante</i> would lay in stores of
that quality. I hunted for a candlestick, and
found a small empty pickle bottle, which
would very well answer the purpose of holding
the candle. This I squeezed under my
waistcoat, and filled my coat-pockets with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
couple of bottles of wine, a handful of ship&#8217;s
biscuit, and a little tin drinking-vessel; and
then putting the box of candles under my
arm, I fell again upon my hands and knees,
crawled to the cabin ladder, and joined the
deck-house so wearied by the posture I had
been forced to adopt and by the convulsive
motions of the deck, which had put an aching
as of rheumatism into every bone, that I was
forced to sit and remain quiet for some
minutes.</p>

<p>The wind swept in through the denuded
windows; but the structure, as I have before
said, was long in proportion to its width, and
at the fore-end the atmosphere was quiet
enough for a candle to burn in. I secured
the empty pickle bottle to a stanchion with
my handkerchief, and placed the lighted
candle in it; and the square of the bottle
held the flame at a sufficient distance from
the stanchion to provide against all risk of
fire. The light seemed to raise some little
heart in Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are brave,&#8217; she exclaimed, with a
glance at the black square of the hatch, &#8216;to
descend into that dreadful dungeon. There
may be dead bodies there.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>&#8216;I am not afraid of dead bodies,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;I wish there were nothing more harmful in
this world than dead men. Here are two
bottles of wine and some biscuit. You will
be the better for a little refreshment.&#8217;</p>

<p>I knocked off the head of a bottle and
handed her a draught. She looked at the
rough drinking-vessel for a little, and then
said with a painful smile: &#8216;A desperate
change, Mr. Dugdale, from the table of the
Indiaman! Will this wine hurt me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will drink first, to reassure you, if you
please,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; she exclaimed; &#8216;I must not be too
cowardly;&#8217; and she drank.</p>

<p>I took a good drain myself, and found it
the same noble wine that the poor lieutenant
had tasted.</p>

<p>&#8216;Try one of these biscuits, Miss Temple,&#8217;
said I; &#8216;they are but coarse eating for you,
I fear; they are the bread that poor Jack is
fed on.&#8217;</p>

<p>She took one and nibbled at it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; said I, &#8216;this is an ocean experience
indeed. This is being shipwrecked. You
will have a deal more to talk about when you
get home than Colledge could have dreamt of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
in proposing this excursion for that purpose.
Can you bite that biscuit?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is rather flinty,&#8217; said I, munching.
&#8216;There should be something more relishable
than this to be come at below. I will make
another hunt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, if you please,&#8217; she cried vehemently;
&#8216;do not leave me, Mr. Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, but food apart, since we must needs
remain here through the night, I must endeavour
to find something soft for you to lie
upon. You cannot rest upon that hard
locker.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I do not want to rest,&#8217; she exclaimed.
&#8216;Do you think I could sleep? I shall sit as I
am, and pray for the light to come and for a
sight of the ships.&#8217;</p>

<p>I made no answer, though it was on the
tip of my tongue to say I was sorry for her
sake that it was I, and not Colledge, whom
she was adrift with. It was an impulse
coming through some sudden hot recollection
of her treatment of me on board the <i>Countess
Ida</i>; but I bit my lip, and was grateful for
my silence a moment after, when I saw her
fine eyes swimming with tears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>&#8216;Pray have hope,&#8217; I exclaimed. &#8216;I am
sure after a bit you will find plenty of courage
in your heart to confront this little passage,
hard as it is. I will do what I can. I would
you had a better sailor than I by your side;
but what can be done by me shall be done,
and the worst is a long way off yet, I am
certain.&#8217;</p>

<p>She put her hands upon the table and hid
her face in them. I lifted the lid of the
locker I was using as a seat, to stow away
the bottles in a safe place; for, talk as I
might, it was only God could know whether
it might not end in a single drop of the liquor
becoming more precious to us than twenty
times the value of the cargo of the Indiaman.
There were some wearing apparel, a few small
coils of ratline-stuff, and other odds and ends
in the locker, but nothing noticeable. I then
clawed my way to the deck-house door to
take a look round. It was black as fog and
darkness could make it. Close alongside, the
foam glanced dimly, with now and again a
flash of phosphoric light in some dark coil
down whose slope the hull was sliding; but
there was nothing else to see. The wind still
blew fresh, but there was no recognisable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
increase in it since the hour of its first coming
down upon the wreck. It made a most
dismal and melancholy noise of howling in the
sky, as it swept through the dark obscurity,
splitting upon the foremast and the shrouds
which supported the spar, in a low-toned
long-drawn shriek, which had something of
the sound of a human note as it pierced
through the hissing and seething round about,
and through the strange, low, dull thunder
made by the shouldering of liquid folds
coming together as they ran, and by the hurl
of the surge as it rounded and dissolved into
foam.</p>

<p>There could be very little doubt that the
drift of a light empty shell of a wreck with a
yard and mast and shrouds forward for the
wind to catch hold of would be considerable
in such weather as this. Helped by the beat
of the seas, she might easily blow dead to leeward,
in the trough as she was, at the rate of
some three to four miles in the hour, so that
daybreak would find her forty or fifty miles
distant from the spot where we had boarded
her. However, I comforted myself with the
reflection that the commanders of the two
ships would have a clear perception of such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
drift as I calculated, and allow for it in the
search they would surely make for the hull.
I had but one fear: that the cutter had been
seen leaving the wreck, for there was an
interval at least of a minute or two between
her dropping astern and man&#339;uvring with her
three oars and her envelopment by the fog.
If, then, she had been sighted, the inference
would inevitably be that Miss Temple, Colledge,
and myself were in her; and so the
hunt would be for the cutter, without reference
to the hull, with every prospect of the
search carrying the ships miles below the
verge of our horizon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as I stood in that doorway
looking into the blackness over the sides, I
bent my ear anxiously forward; but though
there were constant shocks of the sea smiting
the bow, I never caught the noise of water
falling in weight enough upon the deck to
alarm me. The leap of the surge seemed to
be always forward of the fore-shrouds, and
the ducking and tossing of the fabric was so
nimble, and the pouring of the blast so steadfast,
that nearly all the water that sprang to
the blow of the bow was carried overboard by
the wind. This was about as comforting an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
assurance as could come to me; for I tell you
it was enough to turn one&#8217;s heart into lead to
look into that starless wall of blackness close
against the ship, to see nothing but the pallid
glimmer of froth, to hearken to the noises in
the air, to feel the sickening and dizzy heavings
of the sea, and then realise that this hull
had been struck by lightning, that the forepart
of her was burnt into a thin case of
charred timbers, and that all three hatches in
her, together with the skylight, lay open and
yawning like the mouths of wells to the first
rush of sea that should tumble over the side.</p>

<p>I will not feign to remember how that
night passed. The tall wax candle burnt
bravely and lasted long; but the guttering of
it to the circlings of the air in the extremity
of the cabin obliged me to light another before
the night was spent. It a little encouraged
Miss Temple to be able to see. God knows
how it might have been with her had we been
obliged to sit in that blackness. Once the
candle was blown out, and when I had succeeded
in lighting it afresh, after a few minutes
of groping and hunting and man&#339;uvring with
my tinder-box, I looked at the girl, and knew
by the horror that shone in her eyes, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
marble hardness in the aspect of her parted
lips, as though her mouth were some carved
expression of fear, how heart-subduing had
that short spell of blackness proved. From
time to time she would ask for a little wine,
which she sipped as though thirsty, but she
swallowed a few drops only, as if she feared
that the wine, by heating her, would increase
her thirst; yet when I spoke of going below
to seek for some fresh water, she begged me
not to leave her.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is the memory of the body that sat at
this table which makes loneliness insupportable
to me, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; she exclaimed. &#8216;I seemed
to see the dreadful object when the candle
went out. I thought I had more spirit. I
am but a very weak woman, after all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not think so,&#8217; said I; &#8216;you are bearing
this frightful trial very nobly. How
would it be with some girls I know? They
would be swooning away; they would be
exhausting themselves in cries; they would
be tearing themselves to pieces in hysterics.
And how is it with me? Sometimes I am
frightened to death, but not with fears of
darkness or of the dead. I am certain we
shall be rescued; this hull is making excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
weather of it; there is food and drink below,
yet I am filled with consternation and grief.
Why should it be otherwise? We are creatures
of nerves, and this is an experience to
test the courage of a saint.&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, we would exchange a few sentences
after this pattern, and then fall silent for a
whole hour at a time. She never closed her
eyes throughout the night. Whenever I
glanced at her, I met her gaze brilliant with
emotion. The change was so sudden that I
found it impossible to fully realise it. When
I thought of Miss Temple aboard the <i>Countess
Ida</i>, her haughtiness, her character of
almost insolent reserve, how she had hardly
found it in her to address me with an accent
of courtesy, her ungracious treatment of me
after the service I had done her in rescuing
her from a perilous situation: I say when I
recalled all this and a deal more, and then
viewed her as she sat opposite, crouching in
a corner, supporting herself by grasping the
table with her heavily ringed fingers, the
high-born delicate beauty of her lineaments
showing like some cameo in ivory, and reflected
that she and I were absolutely alone,
that it might come to her owing her life to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
me, or that we might be doomed to miserably
perish together&mdash;this girl, this unapproachable
young lady, at whom I had been wont
to stare furtively with fascinated eyes on
board the Indiaman for long spells at a stretch&mdash;I
could not bring my mind to credit the
reality of our situation.</p>

<small>I SEARCH THE WRECK</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> night long it blew a strong wind, but
shortly before daybreak it fined down on a
sudden into a light air out of the south-west,
leaving a troubled rolling sea behind it. It
was still very thick all round the horizon, so
that from the door of the deck-house my gaze
scarcely penetrated a distance of two miles.
It was no longer fog, however, but cloud,
sullen, low-lying, here and there shaping out;
a familiar tropical dawn in the parallels,
though it made one think too of the smothers
you fall in with on the edge of the Gulf Stream.</p>

<p>I stepped on deck to wait for the light to
break, and Miss Temple came to the door to
look also. The hull still rolled violently, but
without the dangerous friskiness of the jumps,
recoils, and staggering recoveries of the night
when there was a sharp sea running as well as
a long heaving swell. My heart was in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
gaze as the dim faintness came sifting into the
darkness of the east. In a few minutes it was
a grey morn, the sea an ugly lead, and the
horizon all round of the aspect of a drizzling
November day in the English Channel. We
both swept the water with our sight, again
and again looking, straining our vision into
the dim distances; but to no purpose.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you see anything?&#8217; exclaimed Miss
Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;there is nothing in
sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, my heart will break!&#8217; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must wait awhile,&#8217; said I: &#8216;this sort
of weather has a trick of clearing rapidly, and
it may be all bright sky and wide shining surface
of ocean long before noon; then we shall
see the ships, and they will see us. But this
is a low level. Something may heave into
view from the height of that mast. I shall not
be long gone. Be careful to hold on firmly,
Miss Temple; nay, oblige me by sitting in the
deck-house. Should you relax your grasp, a
sudden roll may carry you overboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>In silence, and with a face of despair, she
took her seat on a locker, and very warily I
made my way forwards. We had taken but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
a brief view of the hull when we boarded her,
and the appearance of her towards the bows
was new to me. There were twenty signs of
her having been swept again and again by the
seas. No doubt, her hatches had been uncovered,
that her people might rummage her
before going away in her boats; and the
covers, for all I could tell, might have been
rolled overboard by some of her violent workings.
Yet it was certain that she must have
been swept when her hatches were covered,
or the lieutenant would not have found her
with a dry hold. But I had been long enough
at sea to know that it is the improbable conjecture
that oftenest fits the fact of a marine
disaster.</p>

<p>I took a view of the foremast, to make
sure that all was sound with it, and then
sprang into the shrouds and gained the top.
Some few feet of the splintered topmast still
stood, and under the platform at which I had
arrived the foreyard swang drearily to its
overhauled braces hanging in bights. There
was no more to see here than from the deck.
The thick atmosphere receded nothing to this
elevation, and would have been as impenetrable
had I climbed a thousand feet. It was like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
being in the heart of an amphitheatre of sulky
shadows. The water rolled foamless, and there
was little more air to be felt than was made
by the sickeningly monotonous swing of the
solitary spar from whose summit I explored
the ocean limits in all directions, frowning
to the heart-breaking intensity of my stare.
By heaven, then, thought I, we <i>are</i> alone! and
if we are to be picked up by either of the
ships, it will not be to-day nor maybe to-morrow!</p>

<p>I glanced down at the deck of the hull,
and observed that the sides of the fore-hatch
were black with extinguished fire. The head-rail
was gone to port, and from the eyes of
her to the deck-house aft the fabric had a
fearfully wrecked look, with its mutilated
bulwark stanchions, its yawning hatchways,
its dislocated capstan, and other details of a
like kind, all helping to a horrible wildness of
appearance to one who viewed, as I did, from
an eminence, the crazy, fire-blackened, dismasted
old basket, that wallowed as though
every head of swell that rolled at her must
overwhelm and drown her hollow interior.</p>

<p>I again sent my eyes in another passionate
search, then descended. As I sprang from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
shrouds on to the deck, my eye was taken by
the brig&#8217;s bell, that dangled from a frame close
against the foremast. Dreading lest some increase
in the swell should start it off into ringing
in some dismal hour of gloom and heighten
Miss Temple&#8217;s misery and terror, I unhooked
the tongue of it, and threw it down, and rejoined
my companion, whose white face put
the piteous question of her heart to me in
silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I, swaying in front of her as I
held on to the door; &#8216;there is nothing to be
seen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh it is hard! it is hard!&#8217; she cried. &#8216;If
one could only recall a few hours&mdash;be able to
go back to yesterday! I do not fear death:
but to die thus&mdash;to drown in that dreadful
sea&mdash;no one to be able to tell how I perished.&#8217;
She sobbed, but with dry eyes.</p>

<p>There was no reasoning with such a fit of
despair as this, nor was it possible for me to
say anything out of which she might extract a
grain of comfort, seeing that I could but speak
conjecturally, and with no other perception
than was to be shaped by the faint light of my
own hopes. My heart was deeply moved by
her misery. Her beauty showed wan, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was inexpressibly appealing with its air of
misery. The effects of the long and fearful
vigils of the night that was gone were cruelly
visible in her. There was a violet shadow
under her eyes, her lips were pale, her lids
drooped, her hair hung in some little disorder
about her brow and ears; her very dress
seemed significant of shipwreck, mocking the
eye with what the grim usage of the sea had
already transformed into mere ironical finery.
Yet there was too much of the nature she had
familiarised me to on board the Indiaman still
expressed in the natural haughty set of her
lips, even charged as they were with the anguish
that worked in her, to win me to any
attempt of tender reassurance. I watched
her dumbly, though my soul was melted into
pity. Presently she looked at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose there is nothing to be done,
Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Indeed, then,&#8217; said I, &#8216;there is a deal to
be done. First of all, you must cheer up your
heart, which you will find easy if you can
credit me when I tell you that this hull is
perfectly buoyant; that though the weather
is thick and gloomy, the sun, as he gains
power, is certain to open out the ocean to us;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
that there are two ships close at hand searching
for us; that there are provisions enough
below to enable us to support life for days
and perhaps weeks; and that, even if the
Indiaman or the corvette fail to fall in with
us, we are sure to be sighted by one of the
numerous vessels which are daily traversing
this great ocean highway. What, then, are
we to do but compose our minds, exert our
patience, keep a bright lookout, be provided
with means for signalling our distress, and
meanwhile not to suffer our unfortunate condition
to starve us? And that reminds me to
overhaul the pantry for something better than
biscuit to break our fast with.&#8217;</p>

<p>A softness I should have thought impossible
to the spirited fires of her eyes when all
was well with her entered her gaze for a
moment as it rested upon me, and a faint
smile flickered upon and vanished off her lips;
but she did not speak, and I dropped through
the hatch to ascertain if the pantry could
yield us something more nourishing than
ship&#8217;s bread.</p>

<p>The sullenness of the day without lay in
gloom below. I was forced to return for a
candle, with which I entered the little cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
that I had visited on the previous day; but
when I came to make a search I could find
nothing more to eat than cheese, biscuit, and
marmalade. There was a number of raw
hams, but the galley was gone, and there was
no means to cook them. There were two
casks of flour, a sack of some kind of dried
beans, and a small barrel of moist sugar.
These matters had probably been overlooked
when the crew hurriedly removed themselves
from the brig. No doubt, at the time of
jettisoning such commodities as the hold
might have stored, they had broken out as
much food and water as they could take with
them. There was more than a bottle of wine
in the deck-house; down here, stowed away
in straw and secured by a batten, were some
three or four scores of full bottles, all, I
supposed, holding the same generous liquor
contained in the first of them we had tasted.
But there was no fresh water. I sought with
diligence, but to no purpose. Possibly the
people might have left some casks of it in the
hold; but that was a search I would not at
present undertake.</p>

<p>I took some cheese and marmalade and
another handful of biscuits, along with a knife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and a couple of tin dishes. As I passed
through the cabin, the light of the candle I
held glanced upon a stand of small-arms fixed
just abaft the short flight of the hatch-ladder.
There were some thirty to forty muskets of
an old-fashioned make, even for those days,
and on either hand of them, swinging in tiers
or rows from nails or hooks in the bulkhead,
were a quantity of cutlasses, half-pikes, tomahawks,
and other items of the grim machinery
of murder. I placed the food upon the deck-house
table.</p>

<p>&#8216;A shabby repast, Miss Temple,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;but we may easily support life on such fare
until we are rescued.&#8217;</p>

<p>She ate some biscuit and marmalade, and
drank a little wine; but she incessantly sent
her gaze through the windows or the open
door, and sighed frequently in tremulous respirations,
and sometimes there would enter a
singular look of bewilderment into the expression
of her eyes, as though her mind at
such moments failed her, and did but imperfectly
understand our situation. I would then
fear that the horror which possessed her
might end in breaking down her spirits, and
even dement her, indeed. Already her eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
were languid with grief and want of rest,
and such strength and life as they still possessed
seemed weakened yet by the shadowing
of the long fringes. I endeavoured to win
her away from her thoughts by talking to
her.</p>

<p>I possessed a pocket-book, which supplied
me with pencil and paper, and I drew a diagram
of the two ships&#8217; and the wreck&#8217;s position,
as I was best able to conceive it, and made
arrows to figure the direction of the wind,
and marked distances in figures, and enlarged
freely and heartily upon our prospects, pointing
with my pencil to the paper whilst I
talked. This interested her. She came round
to the locker on which I sat, and placed herself
beside me, and leaned her face near to
mine, supporting her head by her elbow whilst
she gazed with eyes riveted to the paper,
listening thirstily. I had never had her so
close to me before saving that day when we
swung together on to the hencoop, but then it
was a constrained situation, and she had let
me suspect that it was very distasteful to her.
It was far otherwise now. She was near me of
her own will; I felt her warm breath on my
cheek; the subtle fragrance of her presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was in the air I respired. I talked eagerly to
conceal the emotions she excited, and I felt
the blood hot in my face when I had made an
end with my diagram, and drew a little away
to restore the book to my pocket.</p>

<p>She now seemed able and willing to converse,
but she did not offer to leave my side.</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose the ships are unable to find us,
Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Some other vessel is certain to fall in
with us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But she may be bound to a part of the
world very remote from India or England.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True,&#8217; said I; &#8216;but as she jogs along she
may encounter a vessel proceeding to England,
into which we shall be easily able to tranship
ourselves.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How tedious! We may have to wander
for months about the ocean!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is always step by step, Miss Temple, in
this life. Let us begin at the beginning, and
quit this wreck, at any rate.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All my luggage is in the Indiaman. How
I am to manage I cannot conceive,&#8217; said she,
running her eyes over her dress, and lifting
her hand to her hat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray let no such consideration as dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
trouble you. The experience will gain in
romance from our necessities, and we shall be
able to read &#8220;Robinson Crusoe&#8221; with new enjoyment.&#8217;</p>

<p>She faintly smiled, with just a hint of
peevishness in the curl of her lip.</p>

<p>&#8216;If this be romance, Mr. Dugdale, may my
days henceforth, if God be merciful enough
to preserve us, be steeped in the dullest
prose.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wonder where Colledge and the cutter&#8217;s
crew are?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not think,&#8217; she exclaimed, &#8216;if Mr.
Colledge were in your place he would show
your spirit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He was a great favourite of yours, Miss
Temple.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not great. I rather liked him. I knew
some of his connections. He was an amiable
person. I did not know that he was engaged
to be married.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was astonished that she should have
said this, but I was eager to encourage her to
talk, and in our state of misery it would signify
but little what topic we lighted upon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did he inform you he was engaged?&#8217;
said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>&#8216;No. I perceived it in his looks when his
cousin asked him the question. Did he ever
tell you who the young lady was?&#8217; she added
listlessly, and though she spoke of the thing
it was easy to see that she was without interest
in it.</p>

<p>I could not tell a lie, and silence would
have been injurious to my wishes for her.
Besides, she had guessed the truth by no help
from me, and then, again, our situation rendered
the subject exquisitely trifling and
insignificant.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I replied; &#8216;we were cabin fellows,
and intimate. He showed me the girl&#8217;s portrait&mdash;a
plump, pretty little woman. Her
name is Fanny Crawley, daughter of one of
the numberless Sir Johns or Sir Thomases of
this age.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was looking through the cabin door
at the sea, and scarcely seemed to hear or to
heed me. Am I strictly honourable in this?
thought I. Pshaw! it was no moment to consider
the rights and wrongs of such a thing.
Her discovery had freed me from all obligation
of secrecy, and what I had supplied
she would have easily been able to ascertain
for herself on her return home, if, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
home was ever to be viewed again by either
of us.</p>

<p>&#8216;What horrible weather!&#8217; she exclaimed,
bringing her eyes to my face; &#8216;there is no
wind, and the sea rolls like liquid lead. When
you were at sea, were you ever in a situation
of danger such as this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is an uneasy time,&#8217; said I; &#8216;but
do not call it a situation of danger yet. I
am going shortly to overhaul the wreck. I
must keep her afloat until we are taken off
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How long were you at sea, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Two years.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is your father a sailor?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No; my father is dead. He was captain
in the 38th Regiment of Foot, and was killed
at Burmah.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a kind of dawning of interest
in her eyes, an expression I had not noticed
when she talked of Colledge and his engagement.</p>

<p>&#8216;My father was in the army, too,&#8217; said
she; &#8216;but he saw very little service. Is your
mother living?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She is.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>She sighed bitterly, and hid her face whilst
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, my poor mother! my poor mother!
How little she knows! And she was so
reluctant to let me leave her.&#8217; She sighed
again deeply, and let her hands fall, and then
sank into silence.</p>

<p>I quitted the deck-house to take another
look round. Just then rain began to fall,
and the sea became shrouded with the discharge.
So oil smooth now was the swell
that each drop as it fell pitted the lead-coloured
rounds with a black point, and the
water alongside looked to be spotted with ink.
As I had met with no fresh water in the little
room that I call the pantry, and as there
might be none in the hold, or none that with
my single pair of hands I should be able to
come at, I resolved to take advantage of the
wet that was pouring down, and dived into the
cabin to search for any vessel that would
catch and hold it. The flour and sugar casks
in the pantry would not do. I peered into
the other berths, but could see nothing to
answer the purpose. It was of the first consequence,
however, to us that we should
possess a store of drinking water to mix with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
our wine, for we were in the tropics; the
atmosphere was heavy with heat, even under
a shrouded heaven; it was easy to figure what
the temperature would rise to when the sun
should shine forth; and the mere fancy of
days of stagnation and of vertical suns, of
this hull roasting; under the central broiling
eye, of the breathless sea, stretching in
feverish breathings into the dim, blue distance,
unbroken by any tip of sail, and no
fresh water to drink, was horribly oppressive,
and rendered me half crazy to find some contrivance
to catch the rain, which might at
any moment cease. The thought of the lockers
in the deck-house occurred to me. I mounted
the ladder and searched them, and to my unspeakable
joy, found in the locker upon which
Miss Temple had been seated during the night,
four canvas buckets, apparently brand new, as
I might judge, from the cloth and from the
rope handles. The rain fell heavily, and the
water gushed in streams from the roof of the
deck-house at many points of it. In a very
short time the buckets were filled, but they
were of a permeable substance, and it was
necessary to decant them as soon as possible.
There was no difficulty in doing this, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
were several empty bottles in the shelves below
along with a couple of large jars, some tin
pannikins, and so forth. These I brought up,
washed them in the rain, and then filled them,
and in this manner contrived to store away
a good number of gallons, not to mention the
contents of the buckets, which I left hanging
outside to fill up afresh, meaning to use them
first, and taking my chance of loss through
the water soaking through them.</p>

<p>All this, that is to be described in a few
lines of writing, signified a lengthy occupation,
that broke well into the day. Miss
Temple watched my labours with interest,
and begged to be of service; but she could
be of little use to me, nor would I suffer her
to expose herself to the wet.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will not this rain fill the hull,&#8217; she exclaimed,
&#8216;and sink her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It would need to keep on raining for a
long while to do that,&#8217; said I, laughing. &#8216;I
am going below to inspect the forepart of her,
and to ascertain, if possible, what her hold
contains. Will you accompany me? The
hull rolls steadily; you will not find walking
inconvenient, and it is very necessary that you
should occupy your mind.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8216;I should like to do so,&#8217; she answered;
&#8216;but ought not one of us to stay here in case
the sea should clear and show us the ships?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Alas!&#8217; said I, &#8216;there is no wind, and the
ships probably lie as motionless as we. This
weather will not speedily clear, I believe.
We shall not be long below, and any sort of
exertion is better than sitting here in loneliness
and musing upon the inevitable, and
adding the misery of thought to the distress
of our situation.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, you are right,&#8217; she exclaimed, rising.
&#8216;You give me some heart, Mr. Dugdale, yet I
do not know why. There is nothing that you
can say to encourage me to hope.&#8217;</p>

<p>To this I made no reply, but took her
hand, and assisted her to descend the ladder.
She came to a stand at the foot of it, as though
terrified by the gloom.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is dreadful,&#8217; she exclaimed in a low
voice, &#8216;to think that only a few short hours ago
the poor lieutenant whose heart was beating
high with thoughts of returning home, should
have been laughing and joking&mdash;here! I can
hear his voice still; I can hear Mr. Colledge&#8217;s
laughter. Hark! What noises are those?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rats!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>The squeaking was shrill and fierce and
close to. I lighted a candle, she meanwhile
coming to my side, her elbow rubbing mine,
as though she would have my hand within an
instant&#8217;s reach of her own. The squeaking
continued. It sounded as though there were
some score of rats worrying something, or
fighting among themselves.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold this candle for a moment,&#8217; said
I, and I advanced to the bulkhead and
grasped a cutlass, and then peeped into the
little passage that divided the after cabins.
The rats were somewhere along it, but it
was too dark to see; so laying the cutlass
aside, I took down a musket and sent the
heavy weapon javelin-fashion sheer into
the thick of the hideous noise. A huge rat
as big as a kitten rushed over my feet;
Miss Temple uttered a shriek, and let fall the
candle.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not be alarmed!&#8217; I shouted; &#8216;the
beasts know their way below;&#8217; and seeing the
pallid outline of the candle upon the deck I
picked it up and relighted it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; she cried, in a voice
that trembled with disgust and fear, &#8216;what
am I to do? I dare not be here, and I dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
not be above, alone. What is more shocking
and terrifying than a rat?&#8217;</p>

<p>I told her that rats were much more afraid
of us than we could possibly be of them; but,
commiserating her alarm, I offered to escort
her to the deck-house.</p>

<p>&#8216;But you will not leave me there,&#8217; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is very necessary,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that I should
examine the state of the hull.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then I will stay with you,&#8217; said she. &#8216;I
cannot endure to be alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>She gathered up her dress, holding the
folds of it with one hand, whilst she passed
the other through my arm. I could feel her
shuddering as she clung to me. Her eyes
were large with fright and aversion, and they
sparkled to the candle-flame as she rolled them
over the deck. At the extremity of the passage
that separated the foremost berths from the
pantry stood what I believed a bulkhead;
but on bringing the candle to it I discovered
that it was a door of very heavy scantling
that slided in grooves with a stout iron handle
for pulling it by. It travelled very easily, as
something that had been repeatedly used.
The moment it was open there was plenty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
daylight, for the open square of the main
hatch yawned close by overhead, of dimensions
considerable enough to illuminate every part
of this interior. I stood viewing with wonder
a scene of extraordinary confusion. There
were no hammocks, but all about the decks,
in higgledly-piggledly heaps and clusters, were
mats of some sort of West Indian reeds, rugs
and blankets, bolster-shaped bags, a few sea-chests,
most of them capsized, with their lids
open, and a surprising intermixture of hook-pots,
tin-dishes, sea-boots, oilskins, empty
broken cases, staves of casks, tackles, and a
raffle of gear and other things of which
my mind does not preserve the recollection.
Several large rats, on my swinging the door
along its grooves, darted from out of the
various heaps and shot with incredible velocity
down through the large hatch that conducted
into the hold, and that lay on a line with the
hatch above.</p>

<p>&#8216;By all that&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash; Well, well! here&#8217;s
been excitement, surely,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Was ever
panical terror more incomparably suggested?
But this brig was full of men, and there was
manifestly a tremendous scramble at the last.
Would not anyone think that there had been
a fierce fight down here?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&#8216;Do you think there are any dead bodies
under those things?&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple
in a hollow whisper.</p>

<p>&#8216;See!&#8217; cried I; &#8216;lest there should be more
rats about, suppose I contrive some advantage
for you over the beasts;&#8217; and so saying I
dragged one of the largest of the sea-chests to
the bulkhead and helped her to get upon it.</p>

<p>This seemed to make her easier. Filled as
my mind was with conflicting emotions excited
by the extraordinary scene of hurry and
disorder which I surveyed, I could yet find
leisure to glance at and deeply admire her
fine, commanding figure, as she stood with
inimitable, unconscious grace, swaying upon
the chest to the regular rolling of the hull.
It was a picture of a sort to live as long as the
memory lasted. There she stood, draped in
the elegancies of her white apparel, her full,
dark eyes large and vital again in the shadow
of her rich hat, under which her face showed
colourless and faultless in lineament as some
incomparable achievement of the sculptor&#8217;s
art: her beauty and dignity heightened in a
manner not to be expressed or explained by
the character of the scene round about&mdash;the
uncovered square of hatch through which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
rain was falling, the wild disorder of the deck,
the rude beams and coarse sides of the interior.</p>

<p>I approached the edge of the hatchway
and looked down. Little more was to be seen
than ballast, on the top of which lay a
couple of dismounted guns, apparently twelve-pounders.
A short distance forward in the
gloom were the outlines of some casks and
cases. The hull was dry, as the lieutenant
had said. Water there undoubtedly must
have been, washing to and fro under the
ballast and down in the run, but too inconsiderable
in quantity to give me the least
uneasiness. One glance below sufficed to
assure me that the fabric of the wreck was
tight.</p>

<p>I considered a little whether it might not
be possible to so protect the yawning hatches
as to provide against any violent inroads of
water should this dirty shadow of weather
that overhung the wreck in wet end in wind;
but there were no tarpaulins to be seen, no
spare planks or anything of a like kind which
could be converted into a cover, nothing but
mats and rugs, which were not to be put to
any sort of use in the direction I had in my
mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>I left Miss Temple standing on the chest,
darting alarmed glances at the huddled heaps
which littered the decks, and walked forward
to a doorway in a stout partition that bulkheaded
off a short space of forecastle from these
&#8217;tweendecks. There was an open forescuttle
here that made plenty of light. This was
the interior that had been burnt out, as the
lieutenant had told me, to the condition of a
charred shell. The deck and sides were as
black as a hat, and the place showed as if it
had been constructed of charcoal. A strong
smell as of fire still lingered. Whatever had
been here in the shape of sea-furniture was
burnt, or removed by the people. I picked
up a small handspike, and entering the cindery
apartment, beat here and there against the
semi-calcined planks, almost expecting to find
the handspike shoot through; but black
as the timber looked it yielded a hearty
echo to my thumps, and I returned to Miss
Temple satisfied that the hull was still very
staunch, and, but for her uncovered hatches,
as seaworthy as ever she had been at any time
since her launch.</p>

<p>Whilst turning over some of the mats and
wearing apparel on the deck with my foot I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
spied a large cube of something yellow, and,
picking it up and examining it, I was very
happy to discover that it was tobacco. I made
more of this than had I found a purse of a
hundred guineas, for, though I had my pipe
in my pocket, I was without anything to smoke,
and I cannot express how hungrily during the
night I had yearned for the exceeding solace
of a few whiffs, and with what melancholy I
had viewed the prospect of having to wait
until we were rescued before I should obtain
a cigar or a pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>&#8216;What have you there, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;
cried Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;A little matter that, coming on top of the
discovery that this hull is as good as a cork
under our feet, helps very greatly towards reestablishing
my peace of mind&mdash;a lump of
very beautiful tobacco,&#8217; and I smelt it fondly
again.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mr. Dugdale, I thought it was a dead
rat,&#8217; she exclaimed. &#8216;What are all those
mats?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The privateersmen used them to sleep on,
I expect. The quantity of them tells us how
heavily manned this old waggon went.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There is no wind, Mr. Dugdale. The rain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
falls in perfectly straight lines. Let us return
to the deck-house.&#8217;</p>

<p>I took her hand and helped her to dismount.
She gathered her dress about her as
before, and passed with trepidation through
the darksome cabin, holding tightly by my
arm, and then, with a wearied despairful air,
seated herself upon a locker and leaned her
chin in her hand, biting her under lip whilst
she gazed vacantly through the little window
at the sullen raining gloom of the sky.</p>

<small>WE SIGHT A SAIL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I should</span> but tease you by attempting to narrate
the passage of the hours from this point.
All day long it rained; no air stirred, and the
leaden sea flattened into sulky heavings wide
apart, on which the hull rolled quietly.
Possessing but the clothes in which I stood, I
fetched an oilskin from the &#8217;tweendecks to
save me from a wet skin, and thus attired
made several journeys into the foretop, where
I lingered, straining my gaze all around into
the shrouded horizon till my eyeballs seemed
to crack to the stretching of my vision. Sometimes,
when in the deck-house, I would start
to my feet on fancying I heard a sound of
oars, but it was never more than some sobbing
wash of swell, or some stir of the rudder
swayed on its pintles by the movement of the
fabric. There was plenty of stuff below with
which to produce smoke, but no preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for such a signal could be made whilst it
rained, nor could any purpose be served by
having the materials ready until the weather
cleared, and wind blew, and something hove
into sight.</p>

<p>Miss Temple&#8217;s miserable dejection grieved
me bitterly. The horror of our situation
seemed to increase upon her, and say what I
might I never succeeded in coaxing the least
air of spirit into her face. It was distressing
beyond language to see this haughty, beautiful,
high-born woman, accustomed to every refinement
and elegance that was to be purchased
or contrived, reduced to such a pass as this:
languidly putting her lips to the rough pannikin
in which I would hand her a draught of
wine and water; scarcely able to bite the flinty
biscuit which, with marmalade and cheese,
formed our repasts; sitting for weary long
spells at a time motionless in a corner of the
rough structure, her eyelids heavy, her gaze
fixed and listless, her lips parted, with all their
old haughty expression of imperious resolution
gone from them, her fingers locked upon her
lap, her breast now and again rising and falling
with hysteric swiftness to some wrenching
emotion which yet found her face marble-like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and her eyes without their familiar impassioned
glow.</p>

<p>I recollect wondering once, whilst watching
her silently, whether there would prove
anything in this experience to change her
character. Should the Indiaman recover us,
there might be a full fourteen or even sixteen
weeks of association before us yet. Once
safely aboard the <i>Countess Ida</i>, would she let
this experience slip out of her mind as an influence,
and repeat in her manner towards
myself the cold indifference, the haughty
neglect, the distant supercilious usage which I
had found so objectionable, that I was coming
very near to as cordially hating her character
as I deeply admired the beauties and perfections
of her face and person. Was she not a
sort of woman to accept an obligation and to
look, if it suited her to do so, very coldly
afterwards upon the person who had obliged
her? Ridiculous as the emotion was at such
a time, when, for all I knew, in a few hours
the pair of us might be floating a brace of
corpses, fathoms deep in that leaden ocean
over the side, yet I must confess to a small
stir of exultation to the thought that supposing
us to be rescued, let her behave as she pleased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
she never could escape the memory of having
been alone with me in this horrible hull, nor
avert the discovery of this circumstance by
her relatives and friends. It was a consideration,
indeed, to bring her mightily closer to
me than ever she had dreamt of, and to my
mind it was as complete a turning of the
tables as the most romantic fancy could have
invented&mdash;that she who could scarce address
me on board the Indiaman for pride, and for
dislike too, for all I could tell, should now be
in the intimate and lonely association of shipwreck
with me, clinging to me, entreating me
not to leave her side; dependent upon such
spirit and energy as I possessed for the food
and drink that was to support us, and again
and again talking to me with a freedom which
she would have exhibited to no living creature
in the Indiaman, her aunt excepted.</p>

<p>When that second night came down black
as thunder, raining hard, the ocean breathless,
I entreated her to rest.</p>

<p>&#8216;You must sleep, Miss Temple,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I
will keep watch.&#8217;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nay,&#8217; I continued, &#8216;you will rest comfortably
upon this locker. You need but a pillow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
There is nothing in the cabins to be thought
of for that purpose; but I believe I can contrive
a soft bolster for you out of my coat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are very kind, but I shall not be
able to sleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>I continued to entreat her, and I saw she
was affected by my earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8216;Since it will please you if I lie down, Mr.
Dugdale, I will do so,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>I whipped off my coat and rolled it up,
and she removed her hat with a manner that
made me see she abhorred even this trifling
disturbance of her apparel, as though it signified
a sort of settling down to the unspeakable
life of the wreck. The fabric swayed so tenderly
that the bottle containing the candle
stood without risk of capsizal upon the table,
and the small but steady flame shone clearly
upon her. How delicate were her features
by that light; how rich and beautiful the
exceeding abundance of the dark coils of her
hair, the richer and the more beautiful for the
neglect in it, for the shadowing of her white
brow by the disordered tresses, for the drooping
of it about her ears, with the sparkle of
diamonds there! Presently she was resting.</p>

<p>I removed the candle to the stanchion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
secured the bottle where the light would be
off her eyes, and sat me down near the doorway
as far from her as the narrow breadth of
the structure would permit, where I filled a
pipe and smoked, expelling the fumes into the
air, and listening with a heavy heart to the
faint sounds breaking from the interior of the
hull to the washing moan at long intervals of
some passing heave of swell, and to the
squeaking of the rats in the cabin below&mdash;a
most dismal and shocking sound, I do protest,
to hearken to amidst the hush and blackness
of that ocean night, scarce vexed by more
than the pattering of the rain.</p>

<p>From time to time Miss Temple would
address me; then she fell silent, and by-and-by
looking towards her, and observing her
to lie motionless, I softly crept to abreast of
her, keeping the table between, and found
her sleeping.</p>

<p>It was then something after ten by my
watch, and she slept for five hours without a
stir, though now and again she spoke in her
sleep. I know not why I should have remained
awake unless it was to keep my
weather-eye lifting for the rats. There was
nothing to watch for or to hope for in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
weather as that. Once, when the beasts
below were very noisy&mdash;for, as you will suppose,
in that solemn stillness their squeakings
rose with a singularly sharp edge to the ear&mdash;I
bethought me of the pantry, and could not
remember whether I had shut the door. For
all I could yet tell, the stores we had to depend
upon were in that little cabin, and if the
rats found their way to the food, we might
speedily starve. I lighted a second candle,
that, should the girl suddenly awake, she
might not find herself in the dark, and stepped
below, and found the door closed. I opened
it, and minutely surveyed the interior, and
observing all to be well, shut the door and
came away; but never can I forget the uncontrollable
chills and shudders which seized
me on passing through that cabin! I do not
doubt my mind had been a little weakened.
The remains of the mainmast pierced the
deck, and stood like a pillar; it stirred to the
movement of the candle in my hand, and I
stopped with a violent start to gaze at it
while the perspiration broke from my forehead.
Vague indeterminable shapes seemed
to flit past and about the stand of arms. The
dull noises in the hold took to my alarmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
ear the notes of human groans. Several rats
scurried in flying forms of blackness towards
the after cabins: they seemed to start up
through the deck at my feet!</p>

<p>When I resumed my seat on the locker, I
was trembling from head to foot, and my
heart beat with feverish rapidity. A draught
of wine rallied me, and I tried to find something
ridiculous in my fears. But all the
same my dejection was as that of a man under
sentence of death, and again and again I
would put up a prayer to God for our speedy
deliverance, whilst I sat hearkening to the
noises below, to the steady pattering of the
rain, to the occasional melancholy sob of
water, and to the broken, unintelligible muttering
of the sleeping girl.</p>

<p>At some hour between three and four my
companion awoke. She sat up with a cry of
wonder, and by the candle-light I observed
her staring around, with looks of astonishment
and horror such as might appear in the face
of a person who starts from some pleasant
dream into the realities of a dreadful situation.
I waited until she should have recollected
herself, to use the fine expressive word
of the old writers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>&#8216;I have been dreaming of home,&#8217; she
said, in a low voice, &#8216;of safety, of comfort, of
everything that I am now wanting. What
time is it, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>I put my watch close to my face and told
her the hour.</p>

<p>&#8216;How black the night continues!&#8217; she
said&mdash;&#8216;how silent, too!&#8217; she added, after
hearkening awhile. &#8216;It has ceased to rain,
and there is not a breath of air.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It has not rained for these two hours
past,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I am impatient for the day to
break. The horizon should be tolerably clear,
if there be no rain; yet what can daybreak
possibly disclose to us on top of such a night
of stagnation as this has been?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you slept?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then you will take some rest now. It is
my turn to watch.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The dawn will be breaking in a couple
of hours,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I will wait till it comes to
take a look. Should nothing be in sight, I
will endeavour to rest. You will not suffer in
the daylight from the feeling of loneliness
that would make you wretched now if I
slept.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>&#8216;Whilst you are here, although sleeping,
Mr. Dugdale, I should not feel lonely. Your
voice assures me that you need sleep. I have
been resting five hours. How patient you
are!&#8217;</p>

<p>She took up my jacket, reformed it pillow-fashion,
placed it on the locker where her
own head had lain, and moved to make room
for me, seating herself where my feet would
about come.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray lie down, Mr. Dugdale. I shall be
closer to you here than you have been to me,
and I can awaken you in an instant if there
should be occasion to do so.&#8217;</p>

<p>I complied, rather to please her than to
humour my own wishes; for though my eyelids
had the heaviness of lead, there was a
thrilling and hurrying of nervous sensation in
me which were as good as a threat that I
should not sleep. And so it proved, for after
I had held my head pillowed for some half
hour, I was still broad awake; and then
growing impatient of my posture, I sat
erect.</p>

<p>&#8216;No use, Miss Temple, I cannot sleep;
and since that is so, pray resume this hard
couch and finish out your slumbers.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>But this she would not do, protesting that
she was fully rested. I was too desirous of
her company to weary her with entreaties,
and until the day broke we sat at that narrow
table with the light close enough to enable us
to see each other clearly. I remember saying
to her:</p>

<p>&#8216;Since this is an experience you were
fated to pass through&mdash;I suppose we must all
believe in the pre-ordination of our lives&mdash;my
sincere regret is that you should not have
been imprisoned in this hull with somebody
more agreeable to yourself than I.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why do you say that?&#8217; she exclaimed,
giving me a look that carried me back. &#8216;In
this state of misery a compliment would be
shocking.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I seek no compliment,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I am
merely expressing a regret.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You regret that you are here?&#8217; she exclaimed.
&#8216;So do I, for then I should not be
here. But since it is my lot to be here, I am
satisfied with my companion; I would not
exchange him for any other person on board
the <i>Countess Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>I bowed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Should we be rescued,&#8217; she continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
keeping her dark gaze full upon me as she
spoke (and something of their beauty and
brilliancy of light had returned to her eyes
with her rest), &#8216;I shall be deeply in your
debt. My mother will thank you, Mr.
Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have done nothing, Miss Temple. It is
you who are now complimentary, and I fear
ironical.&#8217;</p>

<p>She slightly shook her head and sighed,
then remained silent for a minute or two,
and said: &#8216;How small and contemptible my
spirit shows itself when I am tested! Do
you recollect when this wretched brig was
lying near us, how I took a parasol from
my aunt and levelled it at this vessel and
talked of wishing to see a sea fight and of
shooting a man? How brave I was when
there was nothing particularly to be afraid
of, and how cowardly I have shown myself
here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should have scarcely believed,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;that you were sensible of my presence at the
time you speak of.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Indeed,&#8217; I continued, &#8216;I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
scarcely believed that you were sensible that
I was on board the ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale, if my manner did not please
you, this is no time to reproach me with it.&#8217;
Her eyes sparkled and her lip curled peevishly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hark!&#8217; I exclaimed; &#8216;I hear a rippling
noise as of approaching wind.&#8217; I passed round
the table, gained the door, and looked out.
The atmosphere was still motionless, but the
sounds of rippling drew near, and presently I
felt a pleasant little air blowing over the stern
of the hull, accompanied with the tinkling
and lipping noises of water set in motion
trembling to the brig&#8217;s side. But it was still
pitch dark, and search the sky where I would,
I could observe no break of faintness, no
leanest vision of star, no vaguest outline of
cloud in the impenetrable obscurity.</p>

<p>I returned to the table, this time seating
myself opposite to Miss Temple. It was easily
seen in her face that she was sensible I did
this consciously. Indeed, the gaze she rested
upon me was a look of inquiry as though she
would discover whether this holding aloof on
my part was due to respect or to dislike.
Then, as though she suddenly sickened to such
idle considerations, she exclaimed with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
eager awakening of her in her whole manner,
&#8216;Does this breeze come from the direction
where the ships are, or where you may
suppose them to be, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;For the life of me I could not tell you,&#8217;
I responded; &#8216;there are no quarters of the
compass for human senses on such a night as
this, in a hull that may be headed on all sorts
of courses by the set of the swell; but the
dawn will be here anon, and if this draught
hold, we shall be able to find out whence it
proceeds.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was still blowing the same light breeze
when day broke, and I then knew that the
wind sat about north-west. Miss Temple and
I stepped on to the deck, where we stood in
an agony of impatience awaiting the full
revelation of the sea. One saw why it should
have been so pitch dark throughout the night;
the sky was overcast from horizon to horizon
by a sheet of sallowish leaden-hued vapour.
Yet the atmosphere had cleared so as to enable
the sight to penetrate to the verge of the
normal sea-line, where the ocean stood in a
firm rim of the darkness of indigo in the east
against the grey of the morning that was
spreading out behind it. I took a long and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
steady view of the circle; my companion&#8217;s
eyes were riveted upon me as I did so; she
had rather trust my sight than hers, and
her gaze glowed with an inexpressible eagerness
to witness in my face an expression that
should inform her I beheld a sail.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is the same inhuman abominable blankness
as that of yesterday,&#8217; said I, fetching a
deep breath of rage and grief; then shocked
by the air of horror and despair in Miss
Temple, I added: &#8216;Yet this gives us a view of
but little more than seven miles. Here is an
air, surely, to whip something along. The
ships of this ocean cannot all have rotted in
yesterday&#8217;s pestilential calm. Oh for such
another telescope as Mr. Prance&#8217;s!&#8217; and so
saying I trudged forwards, and in a few
minutes was sweeping the horizon from the
elevation of the foretop.</p>

<p>I ran my eyes slowly and piercingly along
the sea-line, starting from the part into which
the vessel&#8217;s mutilated bowsprit pointed, and
when my vision was over the starboard quarter,
I beheld trembling upon the utmost verge of
the livid waters stretching to the shrouded
sky a minute fragment of white&mdash;a tip as of a
seagull&#8217;s pinion, but of a certainty a sail! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
lingered to make sure. Miss Temple watched
me from abaft the deck-house. My glance
went to her for an instant, and I saw her
bring her hands together and lift them, as
though she witnessed in my posture that I
descried something. My heart hammered
violently in my ears, and my breathing was
short and laboured.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you see?&#8217; Miss Temple cried at
last, her rich voice, tremulous with excitement
and expectation, floating up like the
notes of a flute.</p>

<p>&#8216;A sail!&#8217; I exclaimed, calling with an
effort. &#8216;Patience! I must stay here to make
sure of the direction she is taking,&#8217; and I stood
for a minute pointing while she strained her
sight; but there was nothing for her to see
down there.</p>

<p>The breeze had weight enough to determine
the matter with some despatch, and I
knew that if the sail were heading away from
us, it must speedily vanish, so mere a speck
was it that showed. Instead, though I will
not say that it <i>grew</i> whilst I stood staring, it
hung with a fixedness to satisfy me that the
vessel was steering a course that must bring
us into the sphere of her horizon; and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
having the least doubt of this, I dropped over
the short futtock shrouds of the wreck and
sprang on to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is a ship, Mr. Dugdale!&#8217; cried Miss
Temple with something of an hysteric accent
of inquiry in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Assuredly,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will she see us, do you think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, if she does not shift her helm. But
we will <i>compel</i> her to see us.&#8217;</p>

<p>The girl suddenly grasped my hand in
both hers, bowed her head over it, and I felt
a tear. I was so affected that I stood looking,
unable to speak. It was a sort of submission
in its way. I cannot convey my thoughts of
it. She was without her hat; I see her now
as she bent over my hand; I feel the ice-cold
pressure of her fingers, and recall the
tears glittering through the beauty of her
downcast lashes as they rose. She slowly lifted
her large wet eyes to my face.</p>

<p>&#8216;What an experience this has been!&#8217; she
whispered; &#8216;how shall I be able to persuade
people that I underwent it and lived?&#8217;</p>

<p>She still unconsciously held my hand. I
put my lips to her fingers, and she released
me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>&#8216;It must always be one of the very happiest
memories of my life to me,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I shall
never make you believe in the joy your deliverance
will fill me with.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes, yes!&#8217; she cried passionately;
then sending a look over the quarter, she
added: &#8216;Are we not losing time? Is there not
something we can do to summon her to us?
Will it be long before she appears?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No; we are not losing time,&#8217; I answered.
&#8216;I shall have plenty of leisure to make a
smoke, and that is what we must presently do.
If she be the Indiaman or the corvette, all that
is visible of her from yonder foretop is her
royals. Her topgallant sails, her topsails, and
her courses will have to climb before her hull
shows. Her speed to this air will not exceed
four knots. She is probably twenty miles
distant yet, and we must allow her, unless the
breeze freshens, a good three hours to give us
a full sight of herself on that horizon out there.
So let us first get something to eat, Miss
Temple, and then I will go to work.&#8217;</p>

<p>But our excitement was too strong to
suffer us to make more than a phantom of a
meal. A little biscuit soaked in wine formed
my companion&#8217;s breakfast, but her spirits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
had returned to her; the remembered brilliancy
was in her eyes again; a faint, most
delicate flush was on her cheek; with unconscious
fingers she caressed her hair as though,
influenced by a womanly instinct of which she
was insensible, she adjusted her tresses in
preparation of our reception by the people of
the ship. She was sure it was the <i>Countess
Ida</i>. There was real gaiety in the laugh with
which she said that she knew Mrs. Radcliffe&#8217;s
character, that she could well imagine how
her aunt had tormented Captain Keeling, how
ceaselessly the old lady would importune the
captain to make haste and recover her niece.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, what a meeting it will be!&#8217; she
cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;The sail may prove the corvette, though,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;But she will rescue us, Mr. Dugdale, and
hunt after the Indiaman, and Sir Edward will
put us on board of her.&#8217;</p>

<p>I left her to enter the &#8217;tweendecks, where
I collected a number of mats, blankets, staves
of casks, and other material, which would
burn and produce a thick smoke; and presently,
with the assistance of Miss Temple,
had a great heap of these things stacked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
deck betwixt the foremast and the mainhatch.
It was a hard job to get the stuff to kindle,
for the mats were damp and the staves not to
be set on fire by a sulphur match. But on
overhauling the lockers in the deck-house I
found a tin can half full of oil and a small
parcel of rags; and by means of these I set
my bonfire alight. The planks of the deck
were thick and wet, and securely calked, and
the burning stuff was well clear of the hatch;
there was no fear then, as I believed, of the
fire penetrating the deck. It made a prodigious
smoke. The mass of damp blankets
and rags smouldered into a dark thick column,
which mounted high ere it arched over to
the wind. It was a signal to be sighted as
far away as the ship was, and I stood watching
it with transported eyes as it soared in
belching folds gyrating into and blackening
out upon the breeze till it showed like a
steamer&#8217;s smoke or a ship on fire.</p>

<p>I waited a little, and then got into the
fore-shrouds to mark the sail afresh, and
beheld the gleam of her canvas when I was
still two or three ratlines below the futtock
shrouds: good assurance, indeed, of her
rising, and nimbly too, and heading square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for us. I strained my gaze at her from the
height of the top, but she was far too remote
to be distinguishable; nothing more, indeed,
than a little ivory shaft against the sulky sallow
of the sky.</p>

<p>It now occurred to me that I might
accentuate the signal of the smoke by letting
fall the foresail, for here was a space of
canvas that would not only catch the eye, but
suggest the hull as a still inhabited wreck
that was on fire. I called to Miss Temple.
She looked up eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you see those ropes leading to the
deck from the arms of this yard?&#8217; said I,
pointing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I want you to haul them taut, Miss
Temple&mdash;gather in the slack to prevent the
yard from swinging, as I mean to get upon
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>She understood me perfectly. Her jewelled
fingers flashed upon the rope as she threw the
brace off the belaying pin, and I gazed down
with a smile of deep admiration at her noble
figure whilst she swayed at the line tightening
and then belaying it again.</p>

<p>&#8216;You should have been a sailor&#8217;s daughter,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
I cried; &#8216;there is the true skill of the
ancient mariner in your trick of holding on
with one hand and making fast with the
other. Will you please now tighten the
brace on the right-hand side.&#8217;</p>

<p>She did so, and I got upon the yard and,
&#8216;laying out&#8217; upon it, as it is called, severed
with my knife the ropes with which the canvas
was frapped to the spar, and down fell
the sail with a large rent right amidships of
it, though that signified nothing in a square
of white that was to serve as a signal only.
I descended to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why have you loosed that sail?&#8217; inquired
Miss Temple. I explained. &#8216;But will not
the wreck now blow away from that ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I; &#8216;she will fall off and come to.
But the yard must be trimmed to achieve that.&#8217;</p>

<p>So saying I let go the weather-brace and
swung the yard fore and aft as far as I
could bring it, then overhauled the clew-garnets,
that all there was of the sail might
show. The hull slewed to the pressure, then
hung quiet; meanwhile I continued to feed
the blaze, heaping on rugs and blankets and
so firing up that at times the smoke hung as
thick to leeward as a thundercloud.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE &#8216;LADY BLANCHE&#8217;</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">So</span> light was the breeze, that it was drawing
on to ten o&#8217;clock in the morning before the
approaching vessel lay plain on the sea. Long
before this I had made her out to be a square-rigged
craft, and sometimes I would imagine
that she was the corvette, and sometimes that
she was the <i>Countess Ida</i>. It had been a time
of breathless expectation, of crushing suspense.
Again and again had I mounted the
rigging to make sure that she had not shifted
her course, and was edging away from us.
Again and again had I run my eyes round
the sea with a passionate prayer in my heart
that the wind might hold; for if it shifted, we
stood to lose the ship; and if it fell, the
calm might last all day, with the prospect of
another black night before us and a deserted
ocean at daybreak.</p>

<p>But now, drawing on to this hour of ten,
the hull of the vessel had risen to its bends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and though I might be certain of nothing
else, it was absolutely sure that the stranger
was neither the <i>Magicienne</i> nor the <i>Countess
Ida</i>. She had puzzled me greatly for a considerable
time; for even when her fore-course
had fairly lifted she yet seemed to be rising
more canvas. But by this hour I could distinguish.
She was a small vessel, painted
white&mdash;whether barque or ship I could not
then tell. She had studdingsails out and
skysails set, and showed as an airy delicate
square of pearl; and indeed I might have
believed that she was the Indiaman for that
reason, until her snow-white body came stealing
out to the stare I fixed upon her, and
then I looked at Miss Temple.</p>

<p>Her sight for seafaring details was not
mine. She was trembling as she said:
&#8216;Which ship is she, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Neither,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Neither!&#8217; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not you observe that yonder craft
has a white hull, and that she is a small ship?
But what does it matter? She is bound to
see us. She will rescue us; and, let the
future be what it may, our one consuming
need now is to quit this hull.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>She had so reckoned upon the stranger
proving either the corvette or the Indiaman,
that, had the approaching craft been no more
than a mirage, had the fabric melted upon
the air as we watched it, she could not have
looked more blank, more wildly and hopelessly
disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Neither!&#8217; she repeated, breathing with
difficulty. &#8216;Oh, Mr. Dugdale, what are we
to do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, get on board of her, in the name
of God,&#8217; I cried&mdash;&#8216;giving Him thanks when
we are there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But she may&mdash;she will be&#8217;&mdash;she paused,
unable to articulate: then with an effort:
&#8216;She may be going to another part of the
world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It matters not,&#8217; I answered, observing
with rapture that the vessel was heading
more directly for us; &#8216;she will put us aboard
something homeward bound. Will not that
be better than stopping here, Miss Temple?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes, oh yes!&#8217; she cried; &#8216;but if we
waited a little, the Indiaman might find us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Heaven forbid! we have waited long
enough.&#8217;</p>

<p>So speaking, I rushed forward, picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the handspike with which I had beaten upon
the forecastle wall, secured a blanket to it,
and, dancing aft, fell to flourishing it with all
my might. Very slowly the vessel came
floating down upon us with a light swaying
of her trucks from side to side, and a tender
twinkling of the folds of her lower canvas,
which there was not weight enough in the
wind to hold distended. Her hull was exceedingly
graceful, and of a milky whiteness;
and, as she leaned from us on some wide fold
of the breathing waters, she exposed a hand&#8217;s-breadth
of burnished copper, which put a
wonderful quality of beauty and delicacy into
the whole fabric, as though she were a little
model in frosted silver.</p>

<p>&#8216;Before she takes us on board, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217;
exclaimed Miss Temple, &#8216;will not you
mount the rigging to see if there is another
ship in sight that may prove the Indiaman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But even if the Indiaman were in sight,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;we should seize this the first of our
opportunities to escape from this floating
tomb. For heaven&#8217;s sake, let us get aboard
that fellow!&#8217;</p>

<p>As I spoke, I seized the handspike again
and frantically flourished it. All this while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
there was a column of smoke ascending
steadily from my fire of rugs and mats
and darkening the sea over the starboard
bow. I was now able to make out that the
coming craft was a barque. My eyes were
glued to her; my heart thumped furiously;
the wildest alternations of joy and dread
seized me. Suppose she should prove some
foreigner in charge of a man indifferent
to human life, some cold-blooded miscreant
who had shifted his helm merely to satisfy his
curiosity, and who, on perceiving that the
smoke was no more than a signal, and that
the wreck floated high, should slide quietly
on and leave us to our fate? Such things
had been; such things were again and again
happening. As she drew with a snail-like
motion abreast without touching a brace,
without any signs of movement about her
deck, my eyes turned dim; I feared I was
about to swoon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will she not stop?&#8217; exclaimed Miss
Temple, in a voice of terror.</p>

<p>Lifting the handspike with its fluttering
blanket high above my head, I waved it furiously
for some moments, then flinging it down
upon the deck, applied my hands to the sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of my mouth, and, in a voice of such energy
that it came near to cracking every vein in
my head, I yelled: &#8216;Barque ahoy! For
God&#8217;s sake, send a boat and take us off.&#8217;</p>

<p>As the words left my throat, the vessel&#8217;s
helm was put down; the clew of the mainsail
mounted, and her topsail yard slowly revolved,
bringing every cloth upon the main
aback, and in a few minutes the graceful little
craft was lying without way within speaking
distance of us.</p>

<p>In the violence of my transport, I grasped
Miss Temple&#8217;s hand and again and again
pressed my lips to it, congratulating her and
myself so, for I had no words. The figures
of the people were clearly visible: a row of
heads forward, the fellow at the wheel on a
short raised deck, and two men dressed in
white clothes with large straw hats at the
mizzen rigging. One of them leisurely clambered
on to the rail, and, holding by one hand
to a backstay, sang out:</p>

<p>&#8216;Wreck ahoy! How many are there of
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Two of us only,&#8217; I shouted back; &#8216;this
lady and myself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Any contagious sickness?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&#8216;No, no,&#8217; I bawled, amazed by the question.
&#8216;Pray, send a boat.&#8217;</p>

<p>He continued to stand, as though viewing
us meditatively; then, &#8216;Wreck ahoy!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hallo!&#8217; I cried, scarcely able to send my
voice owing to the consternation excited in
me by the man&#8217;s behaviour.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you a sailor?&#8217; he roared.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, say yes, say yes!&#8217; cried Miss Temple;
&#8216;he may be in want of men.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay,&#8217; I cried; &#8216;I&#8217;m a sailor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of sailor?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I belonged to an Indiaman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Afore the mast?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no! send a boat&mdash;I&#8217;ll tell you all
about it.&#8217;</p>

<p>He descended from the rail and apparently
addressed the man that stood near, who
walked to the companion-hatch and returned
with a telescope; the other took it from him,
then knelt down to rest the glass on the rail,
and surveyed us through the lenses for at
least a couple of minutes, after which he rose,
returned the glass to his companion, and
flourished his hand at us. I watched, utterly
unable to guess what was next to happen.
My fears foreboded the departure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
barque, and the impatience in me worked
like madness in my blood. But mercifully
we were not to be kept long in this intolerable
state of suspense. A few minutes after the
man, whom I supposed to be the captain, had
motioned to us with his arm, a number of
sailors came to the davits at the foremost
extremity of the raised after-deck, where swung
a small white boat of a whaling pattern.
Four of them entered her, and she sank
slowly to the water&#8217;s edge, where she was
promptly freed from her tackles, and three
oars thrown over. The fellow in the stern
sheets was the man who had handed the glass
to the other. The oarsmen pulled swiftly,
and in a very short time the little craft was
alongside.</p>

<p>&#8216;Only two of ye, is it?&#8217; said the fellow
who grasped the tiller, a short, square, sun-blackened,
coarse-looking sailor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Only two,&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Any luggage?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothen portable aboard worth carrying
off, is there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I answered, cursing him in my heart
for the delay these questions involved; &#8216;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
are several hams, bottles of fine wine, cheeses,
and the like below.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Odds niggers! we&#8217;ll have &#8217;em then,&#8217; he
exclaimed; and in an instant he was in the
wreck&#8217;s chains, wriggling over the side and
calling to one of his fellows to follow him.
They hung in the wind a moment, staring
their hardest at Miss Temple and myself; then
said the short square man in white: &#8216;Where
be the goods, master?&#8217;</p>

<p>I pointed to the hatch in the deck-house,
and directed them to what I called the pantry.
But nothing could have induced me to leave
the deck. As they disappeared I stepped to
the side where the bulwarks were gone.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bring the boat close under, my lads,&#8217; I
exclaimed to the two fellows in her, &#8216;and
stand by to receive the lady.&#8217;</p>

<p>The hull was rolling gently, with just
enough of depression to render a jump into
the little fabric as it rose very easy and safe.
&#8216;Now, Miss Temple,&#8217; I cried. She sprang
without an instant&#8217;s hesitation, was caught by
one of the sailors, and in a jiffy the pair of us
were snug in the stern sheets side by side.</p>

<p>The two men could not take their eyes off
us. They surveyed us with countenances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
profound astonishment, running their gaze
over Miss Temple as though she were some
creature of another world: as well they might,
indeed, seeing the contrast between the
groaning, mutilated, smoking hull and this
girl leaping from her deck in the choice and
elegant attire of the highest fashion, as the
two poor devils would imagine&mdash;for what eye
would <i>they</i> have for the disorder of her
apparel?&mdash;and her hands, breast, and ears
sparkling with jewels of value and splendour.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are ye English, sir?&#8217; said one of them,
a middle-aged man, of an honest cast of
countenance, with minute eyes deep sunk in
his head, and a pair of greyish whiskers
uniting at his throat.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yes, to be sure,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;The lady too, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, man, yes. What ship are you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Lady Blanche</i>,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where bound?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;To Mauritius, from the river Thames.&#8217;</p>

<p>I glanced at Miss Temple; but either she
had not heeded the fellow&#8217;s answer or her
mind failed to collect its meaning.</p>

<p>&#8216;Been long aboard here, sir?&#8217; said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
man, indicating the hull by a sideways motion
of his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Two nights,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;There should
be a corvette and an Indiaman close at hand
hereabouts. Have you met with either
ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sighted no sail at all?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothen like un,&#8217; exclaimed the other
sailor. &#8216;Th&#8217; ocean&#8217;s gone and growed into a
Hafrican desert.&#8217;</p>

<p>The square man in white, followed by his
attendant seaman, arrived at the side, bearing
between them a blanket loaded with the produce
of the pantry, to judge by the clinking
of bottle glass and the orbicular bulgings of
cheeses and rounds of hams.</p>

<p>&#8216;Catch this here bundle now,&#8217; sung out
the square man, who, later on, I ascertained
was the barque&#8217;s carpenter, acting also as the
second mate. &#8216;Handsomely over the bricks.
It&#8217;s wine, bullies.&#8217;</p>

<p>The blanket and its contents were received,
and deposited in the bottom of the boat. The
men entered her, and we shoved off.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you make up that there fire, sir?&#8217;
inquired the square man, bringing his eyes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a stare of astonishment from Miss Temple to
myself.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; nobody else. This lady and I are
alone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then you&#8217;ve set the bloomin&#8217; hull on fire,&#8217;
said he.</p>

<p>I started, and sent a look at the column
of smoke, at which I had never once glanced
whilst lying alongside, so distracted was my
attention by the multiplicity of emotions which
surged in me. There was no need to gaze
long to gather that more was going, to the
making of the coils of smoke which were now
rising in soot than the nearly consumed remains
of the mats and rugs which I had
stacked and fed.</p>

<p>&#8216;The fire&#8217;s burnt clean through the deck,&#8217;
said the square man, &#8216;and there are some
casks in flames just forrads of the main
hatch. What might they have contained,
d&#8217;ye know?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; I answered, trembling like
a half-frozen kitten as I watched the smoke,
and thought of what must have come to
us, if yonder barque&#8217;s approach had been
delayed!</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose there&#8217;ll be gunpowder aboard?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>&#8217;
continued the square man. &#8216;Pull, lads! If a
bust-up happens, it&#8217;ll find us too near at this.&#8217;</p>

<p>The men bent their backs, and the sharp-ended
little boat went smoking through the
quiet rippling waters. Nothing more was
said. The square man, whose rugged,
weather-blackened face preserved an inimitable
air of amazement, eyed us askant, particularly
running his gaze over Miss Temple&#8217;s
attire, and letting it rest upon her rings. The
toil of the seamen kept them silent. For my
part, I was too overcome to utter a word.
The passion of delight excited by our deliverance&mdash;that
is to say, as signified by our
rescue by the barque&mdash;was paralysed by the
horror with which I viewed the growing
denseness of the smoke rising from the hull.
She was on fire! Great heaven, what would
have been our fate&mdash;without a boat, without
the materials for the construction of a raft&mdash;with
no more than a few staves of casks to
hold by! Such a sea-brigand as the wreck
had been in her day was sure to have a
liberal store of gunpowder stowed somewhere
below: in all probability, in a magazine in
the hold under her cabin. What, then,
would there have been for us to do? We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
must either have sought death by leaping
overboard, or awaited the horrible annihilation
of an explosion!</p>

<p>Miss Temple&#8217;s eyes were large and her
lips pale and her face bloodless, as though
she were in a swoon. She was seeing how it
was, and how it must have been with us, and
she seemed smitten to the motionlessness of a
statue by the perception as she sat by my
side staring at the receding hull.</p>

<p>We swept to the little gangway ladder
that had been dropped over the rail, and
with some difficulty I assisted the girl over
the side, swinging by the man-rope with one
hand and supporting her waist with the
other. The man who had hailed us stood at
the gangway. I instantly went up to him
with my hand outstretched.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you are the captain, no
doubt. I thank you for this deliverance, for
this preservation of our lives, for this rescue
from what <i>now</i> must have proved a horrible
doom of fire.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took my hand and held it without
answering, whilst he continued to stare at me
with an intentness that in a very few moments
astonished and embarrassed me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>&#8216;What is your name, sir?&#8217; he presently
said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Laurence Dugdale,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mate of an Indiaman, I think you said,
sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;I was for two years at
sea in an Indiaman as midshipman.&#8217;</p>

<p>He let fall my hand, and his face changed
whilst he recoiled a step, meanwhile running
his eyes from top to toe of me.</p>

<p>&#8216;A midshipman?&#8217; he exclaimed, with an
accent of contempt. &#8216;Why, a midshipman
ain&#8217;t a <i>sailor</i>! How long ago is it since you
was a midshipman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Six years,&#8217; I answered, completely bewildered
by questioning of this sort at such a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Six years!&#8217; he cried, whilst his face grew
longer still. &#8216;Why, then, I don&#8217;t suppose
you&#8217;ll even <i>know</i> what a quadrant means?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly I know all about it,&#8217; I answered,
with a half-glance at Miss Temple, who stood
beside me listening to these questions in a
torment of surprise and suspense.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are ye acquainted with navigation, then?&#8217;
inquired the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sufficiently well, I believe, to enable me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to carry a ship to any part of the world,&#8217; I
rejoined, controlling my rising temper, though
I was sensible that there was blood in my
cheeks and that my eyes were expressing my
mood.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, then, that&#8217;s all right!&#8217; he cried,
brightening up. &#8216;You tell me you could find
your way about with a sextant?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir, I have told you so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;By heaven! then,&#8217; he roared, &#8216;I&#8217;m glad
to see ye! Welcome aboard the <i>Lady Blanche</i>,
sir. And you, mem, I am sure.&#8217; Here he
pulled off his immense straw hat and gave
Miss Temple an unspeakably grotesque bow.
&#8216;What have you got there?&#8217; he bawled to
the square man.</p>

<p>&#8216;A blanket full of wines and cheeses and
&#8217;ams,&#8217; answered the man, who was helping to
man&#339;uvre the bundle inboards over the side.</p>

<p>&#8216;All right, all right!&#8217; shouted the captain.
&#8216;Now put &#8217;em down, do, and get your boat
hooked on and hoisted, d&#8217;ye hear? and get
your topsail yard swung. Why, who&#8217;s been
and set that wreck on fire?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The flare&#8217;s burnt through her deck,&#8217; cried
the square man in a surly tone, &#8216;and I allow
she&#8217;ll be ablowing up in a few minutes.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>But she was too far distant to suffer this
conjecture to alarm the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let her blow up,&#8217; said he; &#8216;there&#8217;s room
enough for her,&#8217; and then giving Miss Temple
another convulsive bow, he invited us to step
into the cabin.</p>

<p>This was a little state-room under the short
after-deck, and, with its bulkheaded berths
abaft, a miniature likeness in its way of the
<i>Countess Ida&#8217;s</i> saloon. It was a cosy little
place, with a square table amidships, a bench
on either hand of it screwed to the deck, a
flat skylight overhead, a couple of old-fashioned
lamps, a small stove near to the
trunk of the mizzenmast, a rack full of
tumblers, and so forth.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sit ye down, mem,&#8217; said the captain,
pointing to a bench. &#8216;Sir, be seated. I
heard Mr. Lush just now talk of wines, and
cheeses, and hams; but what d&#8217;ye say to a
cut of boiled beef and a bottle of London
stout? Drifting about in a wreck ain&#8217;t wholesome
for the soul, I believe; but I never
heard that it affected the appetite.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are very good,&#8217; I exclaimed; &#8216;our
food for the last three days has been no more
than ship&#8217;s bread and marmalade&mdash;poor fare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
for the lady, fresh from the comforts and
luxuries of an Indiaman&#8217;s cuddy.&#8217;</p>

<p>He went to the cabin door and bawled;
and a young fellow, whom I afterwards found
out was his servant, came running aft. He
gave him certain directions, then returned to
the table, where he sat for a long two minutes
first staring at me and then at Miss Temple
without a wink of his eyes. I observed that
my companion shrunk from this extraordinary
silent scrutiny. I had never witnessed
in any other human head such eyes as that
fellow had. They were a deformity by their
size, being about twice too big for the width
and length of his face, of a deep ink-black,
resembling discs of ebony gummed upon
china. There was no glow, no mind in them,
that I could distinguish, scarcely anything of
vitality outside their preternatural capacity of
staring, that was yet immeasurably heightened
by the steadiness of the lids, which I never
once beheld blinking. His face was long and
yellow, closely shorn, and of an indigo blue
down the cheeks, upon the chin, and upon the
upper lip. He had a very long aquiline nose
with large nostrils, which constantly dilated,
as though he snuffed up rather than breathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the air. His eyebrows were extraordinarily
thick, and met in a peculiar tuft in the indent
of the skull above the nose; whilst his hair,
black as his eyes, and smooth and gleaming
as the back of a raven, lay combed over his
ears down upon his back. He was dressed in
a suit of white drill, the flowing extremities of
his trousers rounding to his feet in the shape
of the mouth of a bell, from which protruded
a pair of long square-toed shoes of yellow
leather. I should instantly have put him
down as a Yankee but for his accent, that was
cockney beyond the endurance of a polite
ear.</p>

<p>I broke into his intolerable scrutiny by
asking him from what port his ship hailed;
but he continued to stare at me in silence for
some considerable time after I had made this
inquiry. He then started, flourished a great
red cotton pocket-handkerchief to his brow,
and exclaimed: &#8216;Sir, you spoke?&#8217;</p>

<p>I repeated the question.</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>Lady Blanche</i> is owned at Hull,&#8217; said
he; &#8216;but we&#8217;re from the Thames for Mauritius.
And what&#8217;s your story? How came
you and this beautiful lady aboard that hull?
You&#8217;re gentlefolks, I allow. I see breeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
in your hands, mem,&#8217; fixing his unwinking
eyes upon her rings. &#8216;You talk of an
Indeeman. Let&#8217;s have it all afore the boiled
beef comes along.&#8217;</p>

<p>So saying, he hooked his thumbs in his
waistcoat, brought his back against the table,
and forking his long shanks out, sat in
a posture of attention, keeping his amazing
eyes bent on my face whilst I spoke. It did
not take me very long to give him the tale.
He listened without so much as a syllable
escaping from him, and when I had made an
end, he continued to craze at me in silence.</p>

<p>&#8216;By what name shall I address you?&#8217;
said Miss Temple.</p>

<p>He started, as before, and answered:
&#8216;John Braine; Captain John Braine, mem;
or call it Captain Braine: John&#8217;s only in the
road. That&#8217;s my name, mem.&#8217;</p>

<p>She forced a smile, and said: &#8216;Captain
Braine, the <i>Countess Ida</i> cannot be far distant,
and I have most earnestly to entreat you
to seek her. I am sure she is to be found
after a very short hunt. I have a dear relative
on board of her, who will fret her heart
away if she believes I am lost. All my luggage,
too, is in that ship. My mother, Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Temple, will most cheerfully pay any sum
that may be asked for such trouble and loss
of time as your search for the Indiaman might
occasion.&#8217;</p>

<p>I thought he meant to stare at her without
answering; but after a short pause he
exclaimed: &#8216;The Indeeman&#8217;s bound to Bombay,
ain&#8217;t she? Well, we&#8217;re a-navigating the
same road she&#8217;s taking. It is three days since
you lost her; where&#8217;ll she be now, then?
That can only be known to the angels, which
look down from a taller height than there&#8217;s
e&#8217;er a truck afloat that&#8217;ll come nigh. Now,
mem, I might shift my hellum and dodge
about for a whole fortnight and do no good.
It would be the same as making up our minds
to lose her. But by keeping all on as we are,
there&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be an hour that won&#8217;t hold
inside of it a chance of our rising her on one
bow or t&#8217;other. See what I mean, mem?
You&#8217;re aboard of a barque with legs, as Jack
says. Your Indeeman&#8217;s had a three days&#8217;
start; and if so be as she is to be picked up,
I&#8217;ll engage to have ye aboard of her within a
week. But to dodge about in search of her&mdash;the
Lord love&#8217;ee, mem! The sea&#8217;s too big
for any sort of chiveying.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>&#8216;I am completely of Captain Braine&#8217;s
opinion,&#8217; said I, addressing Miss Temple, whose
face was full of distress and dismay. &#8216;It
would be unreasonable to expect this gentleman
to delay his voyage by a search that, in
all human probability, must prove unprofitable.
A hunt would involve the loss of our
one chance of falling in with her this side the
Cape.&#8217;</p>

<p>She clasped her hands and hung her head,
but made no reply. The captain&#8217;s servant
entered at that moment with a tray of food,
which he placed upon the table; and the
skipper bidding us fall to and make ourselves
at home in a voice as suggestive of the croak
of a raven as was his hair of the plumage of
that bird, stalked on to the deck, where the
sailors&mdash;who by this time had hoisted the
boat and trimmed the barque&#8217;s yards&mdash;were
coiling down the gear and returning to the
various jobs they had been upon before they
had hove the ship to.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>CAPTAIN BRAINE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> three days of sailors&#8217; biscuit and strong
cheese and marmalade of the flavour of foot
sugar, the lump of cold salt beef that the captain&#8217;s
man set before me ate to my palate with
a relish that I had never before found in the
choicest and most exquisitely cooked meat;
and a real treat, too, to my shipwrecked
sensibilities, was the inspiration of home and
civilisation in the tumbler of foaming London
stout. Miss Temple seemed too harassed, too
broken down in mind, to partake of food; but
by dint of coaxing and entreating I got her to
taste a mouthful, and then put her lips to a
glass of stout; and presently she appeared to
find her appetite by eating, as the French say,
and ended with such a repast as I could have
wished to see her make.</p>

<p>When the man put the tray down, he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
out, and the girl and I were alone during the
meal. Now that I had recovered from the
first heart-subduing shock of the discovery
that the hull was on fire, and could realise
that, even supposing she had not been set on
fire, we had still been delivered from what in
all probability must have proved a long, lingering,
soul-killing time of expectation, dying
out into hopelessness and into a period of
famine, thirst, and death: I say now that I
could realise our rescue from these horrors,
my spirits mounted, my joy was an intoxication,
I could have cried and laughed at the
same time, like one in hysteria. I longed to
jump from my chair and dance about the
cabin that I might vent the oppression of my
transports by movement. I was but a young
man, and life was dear to me, and we had
been in dire peril, and were safe. What a
paradise was this cosy little cabin after that
ghost-haunted, narrow crib of a deck-house!
How soothing beyond all words to the nerves
was the light floating rolling of the graceful
little snow-white barque, under control of her
helm, and vitalised in every plank by the impulse
of her airy soaring canvas, compared
with the jerky, feverish, staggering, tumblefication<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the wreck, with its deadly deck
leaning at desperate angles to the fang-like
remnants of the crushed bulwarks, and its
uncovered hatches yawning to the heavens, as
though in a dumb mouthing of entreaty for
extinction!</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! Miss Temple,&#8217; I cried, &#8216;I cannot
bring my mind to believe in our good fortune!
This time yesterday! how hopeless
we were! And now we are safe! I thank
God, I most humbly thank God, for His
mercy! Your lot would soon have become a
frightful one aboard that wreck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet what would I give,&#8217; she exclaimed,
&#8216;if this ship were the <i>Countess Ida</i>! What is
to become of us? For how long are we to
wander about in a state of destitution, Mr.
Dugdale&mdash;mere beggars, without apparel,
without conveniences, dependent for our very
meals upon the bounty of strangers?&#8217; and she
brought her eyes, with the old flash in them,
from the table to my face, at which she gazed
with an expression of temper and mortification.</p>

<p>&#8216;You would not be a woman,&#8217; said I, &#8216;if
you did not think of your dress. But, pray,
consider this: that your baggage is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
recoverable; whereas, but for this <i>Lady
Blanche</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! but it would have been so happy a
thing, that might so easily have happened too,
had this vessel been the Indiaman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Cannot you summon a little patience to
your aid?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Our strange-eyed captain
spoke with judgment when he suggested the
probability of your exchanging his ship for
the <i>Countess Ida</i> within a week.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I will be patient, if I can,&#8217; said she,
looking down with an air of trouble and distress
in the pout of her lip; &#8216;but is it not
about time that the adventure ended?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Suppose it may be only now beginning?&#8217;</p>

<p>She gave me a side-glance and exclaimed
somewhat haughtily: &#8216;I really believe, Mr.
Dugdale, you enjoy this sort of experiences;
and if I were a man&mdash;&mdash; But it <i>must</i> end!&#8217;
she added with an air as though she was
about to weep. &#8216;It is unendurable to think
of being carried about the world in this
fashion. I shall insist&mdash;well, I shall bribe
Captain Braine to question every ship he
passes as to her destination, and the first
vessel we encounter that is going home I shall
go on board of.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>&#8216;Alone?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; she answered, half closing her
eyes and looking a little away from me;
&#8216;you would not suffer me to travel alone?
Besides, do not you want to get home
too?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather find my way to Bombay,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;My baggage as well as yours is
aboard the <i>Countess Ida</i>, and I should like to
get it, though not at the cost of too much
trouble. I am bound to India on a visit, and
am not expected home for a good many
months. Now, I don&#8217;t see why both of us
shouldn&#8217;t keep our appointments by sticking
in this barque, and sailing in her to the
Mauritius, whence we ought to be able, without
difficulty, to ship ourselves for Bombay.
The <i>Lady Blanche</i> has the hull of a clipper,
and it will be strange if the pair of us are
not ashore at Bombay some weeks before the
<i>Countess Ida</i> sails.&#8217;</p>

<p>She listened with impatience, and when I
had ended, said: &#8216;If the chance offers, I
shall certainly go home. I shall take the
first ship that passes, though it should cost
a thousand pounds to bribe Captain Braine
and the commander of the vessel that receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
me. How is it possible for me to continue
thus?&#8217; and here she looked at her dress.
&#8216;And where is Mauritius? Is it not nearly as
far off as Bombay? Whereas England is
not so very remote from this part of the
ocean.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, Miss Temple, I am your humble
servant,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Head as you will, I shall
most dutifully follow you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I beg that you will not be satirical.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God forbid!&#8217; said I, averting my eyes;
for I was sensible that they were expressing
more than I had any desire she should
observe. &#8216;I wish to see you safe, and meanwhile
happy. If we pick up a ship homeward
bound, we can commission Captain Braine to
request Keeling, if he encounters him, to
transfer our baggage to the first craft he
speaks going to England. Your aunt&#8217;s maid
will know all about your luggage.&#8217;</p>

<p>She watched me, as though doubtful
whether I was joking or not; but I was cut
short by the entrance of Captain Braine.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope you have done pretty well?&#8217; he
exclaimed, after gazing at us for a short time
without speaking; &#8216;it is poor fare, mem, for
the likes of you. But the ship&#8217;ll afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
nothing fresh till we kill a pig. What did
you say your name was, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dugdale,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; he cried, whilst he viewed me steadfastly,
&#8216;to be sure. Dugdale. That was it.
Well, Mr. Dugdale, there might be an edifying
sight for you and the lady to behold from the
deck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What?&#8217; swiftly exclaimed Miss Temple
with a start.</p>

<p>&#8216;The hull, mem, we took you from,&#8217; he
replied in his hollow somewhat deep voice,
&#8216;is rapidly growing into a big blaze.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her face changed to a mood of disappointment.
I believe she thought that the
captain had come to announce the Indiaman
in sight: I was about to speak:</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Braine,&#8217; she said, approaching
him by a dramatic stride, and exclaiming
proudly, as though she would subdue him by
her mere manner to acquiescence in her
wishes, &#8216;I am without wearing apparel, saving
the attire in which you now view me, and it
is absolutely necessary I should return home
as speedily as possible. My mother will fear
that I have perished, and I must be the bearer
of my own news, or the report of my being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
lost may cause her death, so exceedingly delicate
is her health. She is rich, and will reward
you in any sum you may think proper to
demand for enabling me to return to England
quickly.&#8217;</p>

<p>An indescribable smile as she said these
words crept over the man&#8217;s face and vanished.
I was strongly impressed by the expression of
it, and observed him closely.</p>

<p>&#8216;Therefore, Captain Braine,&#8217; she proceeded,
&#8216;I have to entreat you to promise me that you
will signal to the ships you may pass, and put
me on board the first one, no matter what
sort of vessel she be, that is sailing directly
to England.&#8217;</p>

<p>He silently surveyed her, and then directed
his eyes at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll be wanting to get home too, sir, I
suppose?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; I replied. &#8216;Miss Temple is under
my care, and I must see her safe.&#8217;</p>

<p>He turned to her again, and stood staring;
then said: &#8216;That&#8217;ll be all right, mem; we&#8217;re
bound to be falling in with something coming
along presently; and if England&#8217;s her destination
and she&#8217;ll receive ye, the boat that
brought you from the hull shall take you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to her, weather permitting. That&#8217;ll do, I
think?&#8217;</p>

<p>She bowed, looking as pleased as agitation
and anxiety would allow her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come now and take a look at the hull,&#8217;
continued Captain Braine; &#8216;and then&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;You quite understand, I hope,&#8217; she interrupted,
&#8216;that any sum&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He broke in with an odd flourish of his
hand. &#8216;No need to mention that matter,
mem,&#8217; he exclaimed;&mdash;&#8216;we are Christian men
in that part of the country where I come from,
and there&#8217;s never no talk of pay amongst us
for doing what the Lord directs&mdash;succouring
distressed fellow-creatures.&#8217;</p>

<p>With which he spun upon his heels and
walked out of the cabin, leaving us to follow
him.</p>

<p>I had no eyes nor thoughts for anything
else than the hull the moment I saw her. I
remember recoiling as to a blow, and panting
for a few breaths with my hand to my
side. She had slipped to something more
than two miles away down on the starboard
quarter, and although only a portion of her
was as yet on fire, she was showing as a body
of flame brilliant and forked, soaring and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
drooping against the leaden-hued background
of sky. Shudder after shudder went like ice
through me as my sight swept the mighty
girdle of the deep, coming back to the little
body of flame that most horribly to every
trembling instinct in me accentuated the
lonely immensity of the surface on which it
glowed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Think&mdash;if we were on her now!&#8217; I muttered
to Miss Temple. She hid her face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was there any valleyables aboard her,
Mr. Dugdale, d&#8217;ye know?&#8217; said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I cannot tell you,&#8217; I answered in a voice
subdued by emotion; &#8216;I did not search the
sleeping-berths. There was little enough in
her hold.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ye should have crept away down in the
run,&#8217; said he; &#8216;that&#8217;s where the chaps which
peopled her would stow their booty if they
had any. If I&#8217;d known she&#8217;d been a privateersman&mdash;&mdash; How
came ye to set her on
fire?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My signal burnt through her deck, so I
was informed by that gentleman there,&#8217; I replied,
indicating the square man, who stood a
little way from us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>&#8216;Was that so, Mr. Lush?&#8217; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was what so?&#8217; asked Mr. Lush. The
captain explained. &#8216;Well, I dunno,&#8217; answered
the other; &#8216;there was fire in the hold when I
looked down, and it seemed to me as if flakes
of it was falling through the deck. But what
does it signify? Wood ain&#8217;t cast-iron, and if
ye makes a flare upon a timber deck, why,
then what I says is, stand by!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh look, Mr. Dugdale!&#8217; shrieked Miss
Temple at that moment, tossing her arms in
horror, and standing with her hands-upraised,
as though in a posture of calling down a curse
upon the distant thing.</p>

<p>My eye was on the wreck, as hers had
been, and I saw it all. There was a huge
crimson flash, as though some volcanic head
had belched in fire; daylight as it was, the
stretch of clouds above and beyond the wreck
glared out in a dull rusty red to the amazing
stream of flame; a volume of smoke white as
steam, shaped like a balloon, and floating
solid to the sight, slowly rose like some
phenomenal emanation from the secret depths
of the ocean. There followed the sullen,
deep-throated blast of the explosion. Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Braine snatched a telescope from the skylight
and levelled it, and after peering a little,
thrust the glass into my hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;See if you can find out where she&#8217;s gone
to,&#8217; said he with a singular grin, in which his
eyes did not participate.</p>

<p>I looked: the water delicately brushed by
the light wind flowed in nakedness under the
shadow of the slowly soaring and enlarging
cloud of white smoke. Not the minutest
point of black, not the merest atom of fragment
of wreck, was visible. I put down the
glass with a quivering hand, and going to the
rail, looked into the sea to conceal my moist
eyes, too overcome to speak.</p>

<p>&#8216;A good job you weren&#8217;t in that hull,
mem,&#8217; said the captain to Miss Temple; &#8216;it
would be sky high with any one that had been
there by this time: a devil of a mount, as
Jack says. But you&#8217;re aboard a tidy little
ship now. If so be that you are at all of a
nautical judge, mem, cast your eyes aloft and
tell me if there&#8217;s e&#8217;er an Indeeman or a man-of-war,
too, if ye will, with spars stayed as my
masts is, with such a fit of canvas, with such
a knowing cocked-ear like look as the run of
them yardarms has, with such mastheads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
tapering away like the holy spire of a meetinghouse,
and that beautiful little skysail atop to
sarve as a cloud for any tired angel that may
be flying along to rest upon! Ha!&#8217;</p>

<p>He drew so deep a breath as he concluded
that I turned to look at him. He stood
gazing up at the canvas on the main as
though in an ecstasy; his hands were crossed
upon his breast after the manner of coy
virgins in paintings; his right knee was
crooked and projected; I could not have
imagined so curious a figure off the stage.
Indeed, I supposed he was acting now to
divert Miss Temple. I glanced at the tough,
sullen, storm darkened face of old Lush, to
gather his opinion on the behaviour of this
captain; but his expression was of wood, and
there was no other meaning in it that I could
distinguish save what was put there by the
action of his jaws as he gnawed upon a junk
of tobacco, carrying his sight from seawards
to aloft and back again as regularly as the
swing of the spars.</p>

<p>Miss Temple drew to my side with a manner
of uneasiness about her. She whispered,
while she seemed to be speaking of the wreck,
motioning with her hand in the direction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the smoke that was slowly drawing on to our
beam in a great staring, still-compacted mass,
white as fog against the leaden heaven: &#8216;I
believe he is not in his right mind.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No matter,&#8217; I swiftly replied; &#8216;his ship
is sound. Captain,&#8217; I exclaimed, &#8216;I hope you
will have a spare cabin for this lady. For my
part, you may sling me a hammock anywhere,
or a rug and a plank will make me all the bed
I want.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, there&#8217;s accommodation for ye both
below,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;there&#8217;s the mate&#8217;s
berth unoccupied. The lady can have that.
And next door to it there&#8217;s a cabin with a
bunk in it. I&#8217;ll have it cleared out for you.
Come down and see for yourselves.&#8217;</p>

<p>He led the way into the little cuddy, as I
may term it, and conducted us to a hatch
close against the two sleeping berths right aft.
He descended a short flight of steps, and we
found ourselves in &#8217;tweendecks in which I
should not have been able to stand erect with
a tall hat on. It was gloomy down here. I
could distinguish with difficulty a number of
cases of light goods stowed from the deck to
the beams, and completely blocking up all
the forward portion of this part of the vessel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
There were two cabins in the extremity corresponding
with the cabins above, with such
another small hatch as we had descended
through lying close against them, but covered:
the entrance as I took it to &#8216;the run&#8217; or
&#8216;lazarette.&#8217; Captain Braine opened the cabin
door on the port side, and we peered into a
small but clean and airy berth lighted by a
large scuttle. I noticed a couple of sea-chests,
a suit of oilskins hanging under a little shelf
full of books, a locker, a mattress, and a bundle
of blankets in the bunk, a large chart of the
English Channel nailed against the side, and
other matters of a like sort.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll be able to make yourself pretty
comfortable here, mem,&#8217; said Captain Braine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are there any rats?&#8217; asked Miss Temple,
rolling her eyes nervously over the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless you, no!&#8217; answered the captain.
&#8216;At the very worst, a cockroach here and
there, mem.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But this cabin is occupied,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was, young gentleman, it was,&#8217; he exclaimed,
in a hollow raven voice, that wonderfully
corresponded with his countenance, and
particularly somehow or other with his hair&mdash;&#8216;it
was my chief-mate&#8217;s cabin. But he&#8217;s dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sir.&#8217; He gazed at me steadfastly, and added,
&#8216;Dead and gone, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple slightly started, and with a
hurried glance at the bunk, asked how long
the man had been dead.</p>

<p>&#8216;Three weeks,&#8217; responded Captain Braine,
preserving his sepulchral tone, as though he
supposed it was the correct voice in which to
deliver melancholy information.</p>

<p>&#8216;May I see the next cabin?&#8217; said Miss
Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly&#8217; he answered; and going out,
he opened the door.</p>

<p>This room was the same size as the
berth which adjoined it; but it was crowded
with a collection of sailmakers&#8217; and boatswains&#8217;
stores, bolts of canvas, new buckets,
scrubbing brushes, and so on. There was a
bunk under the scuttle full of odds and ends.</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather occupy this berth than
the other,&#8217; said Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re not afraid of ghosts, mem?&#8217; exclaimed
the captain, fixing his immense dead
black eyes upon her.</p>

<p>&#8216;I presume this room can be cleared out,
and I prefer it to the other,&#8217; she answered
haughtily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>I broke in, somewhat alarmed by these
airs: &#8216;Oh, by all means, Miss Temple. Choose
the cabin you best like. Captain Braine is all
kindness in furnishing us with such excellent
accommodation. This stuff can be put into
my berth, if you please, captain. I shall
merely need room enough to get into my
bunk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll make that all right,&#8217; he answered
somewhat sulkily. &#8216;How about bedding?
The lady&#8217;s a trifle particular, I fear. She
wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied to roll herself up in a
dead man&#8217;s blanket, I guess.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Leave me to manage,&#8217; said I, forcing a
note of cheerfulness into my voice, though I
was greatly vexed by Miss Temple&#8217;s want of
tact. &#8216;There&#8217;s more bedding than either of
us will require in less than a bolt of your
canvas. We are fresh from an experience
that would make a paradise of your forepeak,
captain. And so,&#8217; said I, plunging from the
subject, in the hope of carrying off the ill-humour
that showed in his face, &#8216;you are
without a chief-mate?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you about that by-and-by,&#8217; said
he. &#8216;This here crib, then, is to be the lady&#8217;s?
Now, what have I got that you&#8217;ll be wanting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
mem? There&#8217;s a bit of a looking-glass next
door. He used to shave himself in it. You
won&#8217;t mind that, perhaps? His image ain&#8217;t
impressed on the plate. It&#8217;ll show ye true as
you are, for all that he shaved himself in it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple smiled, and said that she
would be glad to have the glass.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;ll be his hairbrush,&#8217; continued
Captain Braine, &#8216;though <i>that</i> might prove
objectionable,&#8217; he added doubtfully, talking
with his eyes fixed unwinkingly upon her.
&#8216;And yet I don&#8217;t know; if it was put to soak
in a bucket of salt-water, it ought to come out
sweet enough. There&#8217;s likewise a comb,&#8217; he
proceeded, taking his chin betwixt his thumb
and forefinger and stroking it: &#8216;there&#8217;s nothing
to hurt in a comb, and it&#8217;s at your sarvice,
mem. If poor old Chicken were here, he&#8217;d
be very willing, I&#8217;m sure; but he&#8217;s gone&mdash;gone
dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked at Miss Temple again. I watched
him with attention. He seemed to sink into
a fit of musing; then, waking up out of it in
a sudden way, he cried: &#8216;You&#8217;ve got no
luggage at all, have ye, mem?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; responded Miss Temple with gravity.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that I didn&#8217;t bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Mrs. Braine along with me this voyage. She
wanted to come, poor thing, observing me to
be but very ordinary during most of the time
I was ashore&mdash;very ordinary indeed,&#8217; he repeated,
shaking his head. &#8216;If she was here
we could manage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, give yourself no concern on that
head, captain,&#8217; said I; &#8216;we shall be falling in
with the Indiaman presently; and supposing
the worst to come to the worst&mdash;what time do
you give yourself for the run from here to the
Mauritius?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not agoing to say&mdash;I&#8217;m not agoing to
say!&#8217; he cried with an accent of excitement
that astonished me; &#8216;what&#8217;s the good of
talking when you don&#8217;t know? Wouldn&#8217;t it
be a sin to go and make promises to people in
your condition and disappoint &#8217;em? I can
just tell ye this: that Baltimore itself never
turned out a keel able to clip through it as
this here <i>Lady Blanche</i> can when the chance
is given her. And now,&#8217; he exclaimed, changing
his voice, &#8216;suppose we clear out of this, and
go up into the daylight and fresh air;&#8217; and
without pausing for an answer he trudged
off.</p>

<p>I handed Miss Temple up the ladder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
we gained the little cabin, or living-room as it
might be termed. The young fellow who acted
as steward or servant was busy at the glass-rack.
The captain called to him, and peremptorily
and most intelligently gave him
certain instructions with respect to the clearing
out and preparing of the berths below for our
reception. He told him where he would find
a spare mattress&mdash;&#8216;Quite new, never yet slept
on,&#8217; he said, contorting his figure into a bow
to Miss Temple&mdash;he had a couple of shawls
and a homely old rug which had made several
voyages, and these were to be put into her
bunk; the man was to see that the lady lacked
no convenience which the barque could afford.
&#8216;The late Mr. Chicken&#8217;s mattress was to be
given to me along with his bedding, if so be
that I was willing to use the same.&#8217; Other
instructions, all expressive of foresight and
hospitable consideration, he gave to the fellow,
who then went forward to obtain help to clear
out the cabins.</p>

<p>&#8216;We are deeply indebted to you, captain,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;for this very generous behaviour&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not a word, sir, if you please,&#8217; he interrupted.
&#8216;I have a soul as well as another,
and I know my duty. Lady, a hint: you have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
some fine jewelry upon you; take my advice
and put it in your pocket.&#8217;</p>

<p>She was alarmed by this, and looked at
me.</p>

<p>I smiled, and said, &#8216;The captain of a
ship is Lord Paramount; his orders must be
obeyed, Miss Temple.&#8217;</p>

<p>Without another word she began to pull
off her rings, the skipper steadfastly watching
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will you take charge of them for me, Mr.
Dugdale?&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>I placed them in my pocket. She then
took off a very beautiful diamond locket from
her throat, and this I also carefully stowed
away.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will remove my earrings presently,&#8217; she
exclaimed with a slight flush in her cheek and
a sparkle as of ire in her gaze, though her lips
still indicated an emotion of dismay.</p>

<p>&#8216;My advice to you is&mdash;at once, mem,&#8217; said
the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;We must believe that Captain Braine is
fully sensible of the meaning of his requests,&#8217;
said I, answering the glance she shot at me.</p>

<p>She removed the earrings and gave them
to me. The captain stood running his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
over her figure; then, with a melodramatic
gesture, pointed to her watch. This, too, with
the handsome chain belonging to it, I pocketed.
He now addressed himself to contemplating
me.</p>

<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t need to show any watch-chain,&#8217;
said he, speaking with his head drooping
towards his left shoulder; &#8216;there&#8217;s no good in
that signet ring either. As to the breast-pin&#8217;&mdash;he
half-closed one eye&mdash;&#8216;well, perhaps that&#8217;s a
thing that won&#8217;t hurt where it is.&#8217;</p>

<p>He waited until I had taken off my ring
and dropped my chain into my waistcoat
pocket, and then, looking first of all aft and
then forward, then up at the little skylight,
whilst he seemed to hold his breath as though
intently listening, he approached us, as we
stood together, by a stride, and said in a low
deep voice, tremulous with intensity of utterance:
&#8216;My men are not to be trusted. Hush!
If they imagined I suspected them, they would
cut my throat and heave me overboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple took my arm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let me understand you?&#8217; said I, wrestling
with my amazement. &#8216;In what sense are they
untrustworthy?&#8217;</p>

<p>He stared eagerly and nervously about him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
again, and then, extending the fingers of his
left hand, he touched one of them after
another, as though counting, whilst he said:
&#8216;First, I have reason to believe that Lush, the
carpenter, who acts as my second mate, committed
a murder four years ago.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Good God!&#8217; I ejaculated.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold!&#8217; he cried. &#8216;Next, there ain&#8217;t no
shadow of a doubt that two at least of my
able seamen are escaped convicts. Next, there
is a man forward who was concerned in a
mutiny that ended in the ringleaders being
hung. Next&#8217;&mdash;he paused, and then exclaimed:
&#8216;but no need to go on alarming the lady.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But were you not acquainted with these
men&#8217;s characters at the time of their signing
articles?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, young man&mdash;no,&#8217; he answered with
a most melancholy shake of the head; &#8216;it&#8217;s all
come out since, and a deal more atop of it.
But hush! Discretion is the better part of
valour, as Jack says. There&#8217;s no call to be
afraid. They know the man I am, and what&#8217;s
better, they know I know <i>them</i>. Ye&#8217;re quite
safe, mem; only, don&#8217;t be a-tempting sailors
of their sort by a sight of the valleyables you&#8217;ve
been a-carrying about with you. And now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
perhaps you&#8217;ll excuse me whilst I goes and
looks after the ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>He gave us another extraordinary bow&mdash;I
never met with any posture-maker who
approached this man in the capacity of distorting
his person&mdash;and walked out of the
cabin.</p>

<small>THE CREW OF THE BARQUE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Miss Temple</span> released my arm and sank upon
a bench.</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you doubt now that he is mad?&#8217; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Somewhat eccentric, certainly, but perhaps
not mad, though. He is treating us
very kindly. How intelligently he instructed
his man in regard to our cabins!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He may be kind; but I believe we should
have been safer on the hull than here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh no, no, no!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But I say yes,&#8217; she exclaimed in her most
imperious air, and gazing at me with hot and
glowing eyes. &#8216;It is quite true the wreck
was burnt; but if this vessel had not come
into sight, you would not have signalled, and
then the hull would not have been set on fire.
It is maddening to think that perhaps within
the next three or four hours the Indiaman or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the corvette may sail over the very spot
where the wreck blew up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I heartily hope that one or the other
will do so,&#8217; said I; &#8216;for if she be so close
to us as all that, we&#8217;re bound to fall in with
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>She looked at her hands, turning her
fingers back and front, as though they were
some novel and unexpected sight to her.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wonder, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; said she, &#8216;you
can doubt that the man is insane. Remember
the extraordinary questions he put to you
when we first arrived. I believe, had you
told him you were ignorant of navigation, he
would have sent us back to the wreck. And
then how he stares! There is something
shocking in the fixed regard of his dreadfully
inanimate black eyes. What a very extraordinary
face, too! I cannot believe that he
is a sailor. He has the appearance of a monk
just released from some term of fearful
penance and mortification.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;On the other hand he has received us
very kindly. He would not suffer you to
speak of paying him. He promptly set us
down to such entertainment as his vessel
furnishes. He may be mad half-way round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the compass, but all the rest of the points
are sound,&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am astonished,&#8217; she cried with a manner
of petulant vivacity, &#8216;to hear you say that we
are safer in this ship than had we remained in
the hull. There we were alone; but who are
the people with whom we must be locked up
in this vessel until we sight the Indiaman or
some sail that will receive us? A murderer&mdash;convicts&mdash;mutineers&mdash;a
crew of men in whose
sight a jewel must not be exhibited lest they
should be tempted. Tempted to what?&#8217; She
violently shuddered. &#8216;How can you speak of
this ship as safer than the wreck?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Because I happen to feel quite certain
that she is; but I will not say so, for it vexes
you to hear me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh this ridiculous, this horribly ridiculous
degrading situation fills me with anger. To
think of being reduced to a perfect state of
squalor&mdash;having to conceal one&#8217;s jewelry for
fear of&mdash;of&mdash;something awful, I am sure; and
you dare not, though you <i>could</i> name it, Mr.
Dugdale.&#8217; I smiled, and her warmth increased.
&#8216;That I should have been ever tempted,&#8217; she
proceeded, &#8216;to undertake the odious voyage
to Bombay, for <i>this</i>! To be without a change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of dress, to be obliged to sleep in a little dark
horrid cabin, and meanwhile not to have the
least notion when it is all to end!&#8217;</p>

<p>Well, thought I, as I looked at her eyes
shining with spirit and temper, and marked
the faint hectic of her ill-humour in her
cheeks, the expression of mingled pride and
fretfulness in her lips, the wrathful rising and
falling of her breast, here, to be sure, is a new
version of the play of Katharine and Petruchio;
only, though she be Kate to the life, it
is not I, but old daddy Neptune who is to
break her spirit, and unshrew her into somebody&#8217;s
very humble servant. But is there any
magic, I thought, even in ocean&#8217;s rough,
brutal, unconscionable usage to render docile
such a woman as this? Nay, would any man
wish it otherwise with her than as it is when
he gazes at her eyes and figure, beholds the
dignity and haughtiness of her carriage, the
assumption of maiden sovereignty visible in
every move of her arm, in every curl of her
lip, in every motion of her form!</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you thinking of?&#8217; she asked:
&#8216;you are plunged in thought. I hope you are
struggling to do justice to my perception of
the truth.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>I started, and then laughed out. &#8216;I will
not tell you what I was thinking of,&#8217; said I;
&#8216;but I will express what was in my mind
whilst you were speaking just now. You
dwell with horror upon the captain&#8217;s account
of his crew. Well, I heartily wish for both
our sakes that they were an honest straight-headed
body of men. But then every ship&#8217;s
forecastle is a menagerie. There is ruffianism,
and there is respectability. Quite likely that
the carpenter Lush may have killed a man;
but one must hear the story before deciding
to call him a murderer. So of the convicts;
so of the mutineers. In many ships at sea
there is unspeakable provocation, and crimes
are committed of which the blood rests upon
the head of anyone sooner than those who are
held guilty and punished by the law. I am
not to be greatly frightened by Captain
Braine&#8217;s talk of his crew, particularly since in
a few days we may either be on board the
Indiaman or homeward-bound in another ship.
Let us now go on deck. I wish to take a
view of the sailors, and see what sort of a
craft this is, for as yet I have seen but little
of her.&#8217;</p>

<p>I could not help remarking that she kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
very close to me as we made our way out of
the cuddy, and that the glances she directed
forwards where some seamen were at work
were full of apprehension. The short poop of
the <i>Lady Blanche</i> was gained by a central
ladder falling fair in the face of the little doorway
of the cuddy front with its two small
windows and row of buckets. A low, handsomely
carved wooden rail was fixed athwart
the break of this raised deck, and I stood
with Miss Temple at a point of it that provided
me with a clear view fore and aft. The
captain sat on a grating abaft the wheel reading.
Mr. Lush was near the mizzen rigging,
gazing seawards with a stubborn wooden expression
of face. After the spacious decks
and wide topgallant-forecastle of the Indiaman,
this little <i>Lady Blanche</i> looked a mere
toy. But though a ship shows least admirably
from her own deck, I found a deal to please
and even delight me in the first comprehensive
look I threw around. She was as clean as a
yacht; the insides of her bulwarks were
painted a delicate green, and they were as
spotless as though the brush were just off
them; on either side were two little brass
guns, mounted on carriages, and they shone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
as freshly as though the sunlight were upon
them; the running gear was everywhere
neatly coiled away. The small caboose, with
its smoking chimney, abaft the foremast; the
length of windlass close in under the overlap
of the short space of forecastle; the white
longboat; the white scuttle-butt abreast of
it; the little winch abaft the mainmast; the
brass-lined circle of the wheel in the grasp of
the sober, good-tempered-looking old fellow
who had made one of the boat&#8217;s crew; the
two shapely clinker-built quarter-boats hanging
at the davits abreast of the mizzen mast&mdash;these
and much more seemed details of a
miniature delicacy and finish, that entered
with surprising effect into the fabric&#8217;s general
character of toy-like grace and elegance. On
high, the white canvas soared in symmetrical
spaces; but after the towering spires of the
Indiaman, the main-yard of this little barque
seemed within reach of the hand, and the
tiny skysail that crowned the summit of the
airy, snow-white, faintly-swelling cloths, no
bigger than a lady&#8217;s pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is really a beautiful little ship, Miss
Temple,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I might be able to admire her from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
deck of the <i>Countess Ida</i>,&#8217; she answered; &#8216;but
there must be happiness to enable me to find
beauty, and I am not happy here.&#8217;</p>

<p>I searched the sea-line, but it was as bare
and flawless as the rim of a brand-new guinea.
The dull shadow of the morning still overspread
the heavens; it was the same leaden
sky, with here and there a little break of
faintness, revealing some edge of apparently
motionless cloud, and the ocean lay sallow
beneath it, darker than it was for the pencilling
of the ripples which wrinkled the wide
expanse as they rode the long, light heave of
the swell. There were some sailors at work
in the waist on jobs, of which I forget the
nature; I examined them attentively&mdash;they
were within easy eyeshot; but though there
was no lack of prejudice in my observation,
I protest I could find nothing rascally in their
appearance. They were all of them of the
then familiar type of merchant seaman, as like
to members of the crew of the Indiaman as
one pea is to another; faces burnt by the sun
and decorated with the usual assemblage of
warts and moles, all of them of an unmistakably
English cut&mdash;I am speaking of the five
of them then visible&mdash;dressed in the rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
apparel of the ocean, rude shirts revealing
the bare hairy breast, duck breeches with
stains of oil and tar in them which there was
no virtue in the scrubbing-brush and the lee-scuppers
to remedy. Miss Temple, standing
at my side, gazed at them.</p>

<p>&#8216;They have quite the look of cut-throats,
I think,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, now, to my fancy,&#8217; said I, &#8216;they
seem as honest a set of lively hearties as one
could wish to sail with.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You merely say that to encourage me,&#8217;
she exclaimed with a pout of vexation. &#8216;Observe
that man with the black beard&mdash;the one
that is nearest to us. Could you figure a completer
likeness of a pirate? I do not like his
way of glancing at us out of the corner of his
eyes. An honest sailor would stare boldly.&#8217;</p>

<p>I laughed, and then put on a face of
apology.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will be smiling at these fears in a
few days, I hope,&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; but it is the meanwhile we have to
think of,&#8217; she answered. &#8216;Look at that man
there&#8217;&mdash;meaning Mr. Lush; &#8216;pray, tell me,
Mr. Dugdale, that he has a very handsome,
manly, good-tempered face.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>&#8216;No; I confess I don&#8217;t like his appearance,&#8217;
I answered, stealing a peep at the sulky-looking
old dog, who continued to stare at the
horizon with the immovability of a figure-head;
&#8216;yet inside of that hide there may be
stowed away a very worthy member of society.
A crab-apple is not a fruit to delight the eye;
but I believe it is wholesome eating, though
a trifle austere.&#8217;</p>

<p>At that moment the captain looked up
from his book, and after taking a prolonged
view of us, came in a slow walk to where we
were standing, holding the volume in his
hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;You have a charming little ship here,
captain,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I am exceedingly pleased
with her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir; she&#8217;s a handy craft. She will
do her work,&#8217; he answered, sending his unwinking
eyes with their sort of slow dead look
along the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Which of those men down there are the
convicts and mutineers?&#8217; began Miss Temple.</p>

<p>He whipped round upon her with a vehemence
of manner that seemed a veritable fury
of temper to the first seeing and hearing of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;For God Almighty&#8217;s sake, not a word!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
D&#8217;ye want to see me a murdered man?&#8217; He
twisted round on to me: &#8216;Sir, you are to
know nothing if you please. This lady is to
know nothing. I asked ye both in the cabin
to be secret. God&#8217;s death! if that man
yonder had overheard her!&#8217; He stopped
short, pointing with his thumb over his
shoulder at Lush.</p>

<p>Miss Temple was deadly pale. She had
the same cowed air I had observed in her
during our first few hours aboard the wreck.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am very sorry&mdash;&#8217; she muttered.</p>

<p>&#8216;For the love of God, mem!&#8217; he exclaimed
in a whisper, putting his finger to his lips.</p>

<p>It was time to change the subject. I
asked him how long he had occupied in his
passage from the Thames to this point, spoke
of the light trade-wind and baffling airs we
had encountered, told him once again of the
privateering brig, asked him what he thought
would be the chance of the corvette&#8217;s cutter
in such weather as she went adrift in, and in
this way coaxed him out of his temper until
I had got him to some posture of affability
once more. I do not recollect the number
of days he named as contained in his passage
from London, but I can remember that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
a very swift run, proving daily totals which
must have come very near to steam at
times.</p>

<p>&#8216;Such a nimble keel as this should make
you very easy, Miss Temple,&#8217; said I; &#8216;why,
here is a craft to sail round and round the
<i>Countess Ida</i>. Even though we shouldn&#8217;t pick
her up, it is fifty to one that of all her
passengers we two shall be the first to arrive
in India.&#8217;</p>

<p>She fastened her eyes upon the deck
with a countenance of incredulity and
despair.</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose your port will be St. Louis,
sir?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He stared at me for some moments without
speaking, and then slowly inclined his
head in a single nod.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was never in that island,&#8217; I continued;
&#8216;but I presume we shall not be at a loss for
a vessel to carry us to some part of India
whence we may easily make our way to Bombay.&#8217;</p>

<p>His lack-lustre gaze seemed to grow deader
as, after a pause, he exclaimed: &#8216;There&#8217;ll be
some French skipper to make terms with, I
don&#8217;t doubt, for a passage north.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>&#8216;You talk, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; said Miss Temple,
&#8216;as though you were well assured that we
should not fall in with the Indiaman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am desirous of creating plenty of
chances for ourselves,&#8217; said I; then gathering
that this might not be a topic profitable to
pursue in the presence of so singular a listener
as Captain Braine, I again branched off.
&#8216;How many,&#8217; said I carelessly, &#8216;go to a crew
with you, captain?&#8217;</p>

<p>He answered leisurely: &#8216;Thirteen as we
now are, all told. There was fourteen afore
Mr. Chicken died.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, even at that,&#8217; said I, &#8216;a single
watch should be able to reef down for you.
I suppose&#8217;&mdash;here I sunk my voice&mdash;&#8216;that Mr.
Lush yonder is now your chief mate?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; he replied, speaking stealthily; &#8216;I&#8217;m
my own chief mate. He&#8217;s the ship&#8217;s carpenter,
and stands watch as second officer.
But what are ye to do,&#8217; he proceeded, preserving
his stealthy delivery, &#8216;with a man
whose education don&#8217;t let him go no further
than making a mark for his name?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then, I take it, there is nobody aboard
capable of navigating the vessel but yourself?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>&#8216;We&#8217;ll talk about that presently,&#8217; said he
with a singular look, and pointing with his
finger to the deck.</p>

<p>I observed that Miss Temple narrowly
watched him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was Mr. Chicken a pretty good navigator?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>He appeared to forget himself in thought,
then with a slow emerging air, so to speak,
and a steadfast, quite embarrassing stare, he
responded: &#8216;Chicken was acquainted with
the use of the sextant. He likewise understood
the meaning of Greenwich time. He
couldn&#8217;t take a star; but his reckonings was
always close when he got them out of the sun.
He&#8217;d been bred a collierman, and it took him
some time to recover the loss of coasts and lee
shores and lights. But he was a good sailor,
and a religious man; and his death was a
blow, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Almost a pity that it wasn&#8217;t Mr. Lush
who was beckoned overboard,&#8217; said I. (The
carpenter had now trudged aft, and was looking
into the compass out of hearing.)</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; exclaimed Captain Braine, heaving
a deep sigh and shaking his head: &#8216;Lush&#8217;s
loss would have been my gain. One Chicken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
was worth all the Lushes that were ever afloat.&mdash;But
hush, mem, if <i>you</i> please.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall certainly say nothing more about
your crew,&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple quickly
and a little haughtily, while she slightly
recoiled from the face he turned upon her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you any books aboard, Captain
Braine?&#8217; said I, glancing at the volume he
held in his hand. &#8216;Any sort of amusement
in the shape of chess or cards to help Miss
Temple and myself to kill an hour or two from
time to time?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There are some vollums in Chicken&#8217;s
cabin that belonged to him,&#8217; answered Captain
Braine. &#8216;I&#8217;ve read two or three of them.
His cargo that way was usually edifying.
There&#8217;s Baxter&#8217;s &#8220;Shove:&#8221; a good yarn; there&#8217;s
the &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress;&#8221; and there&#8217;s the &#8220;Whole
Dooty o&#8217; Man&#8221;&mdash;a bit leewardly; I couldn&#8217;t
fetch to windward in it myself. For my part,
one book&#8217;s enough for me; and excepting
some vollums on navigation, it is the only
work I goes to sea with.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The Bible!&#8217; I exclaimed, taking it from
him. I was astonished and pleased. There
seemed little for one to apprehend in the
character of a man who could dedicate his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
leisure to the study of that Book, and I was
sensible of an emotion of respect for the
strange-looking, staring figure as I returned
the little volume to him.</p>

<p>He dropped it into a side-pocket, and then
most abruptly walked to the rail, took a long
look at the weather and a long look aloft,
trudged over to Mr. Lush, with whom he
exchanged a sentence or two, and immediately
afterwards disappeared down the companion.</p>

<p>For some time after this Miss Temple and
I paced the deck together. There was much
to talk about, and my companion found a deal
to say about Captain Braine, whilst, as we
walked, I would catch her taking furtive peeps
at Mr. Lush, who, it was easy to see, had
inspired her with aversion and fear, though
the man had not offered to address a word to
us, nor had he once looked our way, thirstily
inquisitive as his stare had been whilst in the
boat. I could not help contrasting her
behaviour now with what I recollected of it
aboard the <i>Countess Ida</i>. She had put her
hand into my arm, and the intimacy of our
association in this way might well have
suggested an affianced pair. She talked
eagerly and with all the passion of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
emotions which rose in her with her references,
to our situation, to her aunt, to the chance of
our sighting the Indiaman, and the like; and
I don&#8217;t doubt that the men who watched us
from the forepart of the vessel put us down
either as husband and wife or a betrothed
couple.</p>

<p>And all this in three days! Three days
ago she could hardly bring herself to speak
or even to look at me; and now fortune had
contrived that she should have no other
companion, that she should be locked up with
me alone in a dismasted hull, and then be
brought, always with me at her side, into a
vessel where, as she believed, there was much
more to fill us with alarm than in the worst
of the conditions which entered into our
existence aboard the wreck! Again and again
she would ask, with her dark and glowing
eyes bent with an expression of despair upon
my face, when it was to end and how it was
to end; and these questions my heart would
echo as I gazed at the cold and alarmed beauty
of her face, but with a very different meaning
from what she attached to the inquiries.</p>

<p>At last she grew weary of walking, and I
took her below and sat with her awhile on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
cushioned locker. It was now drawing on to
four o&#8217;clock in the afternoon; the breeze
quiet, the sky in shadow, the sea very smooth
save for the soft undulation of the swell,
which pleasantly and soothingly cradled the
little fabric as she slipped through it, of a
milky white from water-line to truck, to the impulse
of her wide overhanging pinions. After
a bit, I observed a heaviness in the lids of my
companion, and urged her to lie down and take
some rest. She consented; and I lingered at her
side until sleep overcame her, and then I stood
for awhile surveying with deep admiration the
calm sweetness of her face, into which had
stolen the tenderness of the unconscious
woman, softening down the haughty arching
of eyebrow, unbending the imperious set of
the mouth. It was as though her spirit clad
in her own beauty was revealed to me disrobed
of all the trappings of the waking
humours. I could have knelt by her side,
and in that posture have watched her for an
hour. Can it be, thought I, as I crept softly to
the cuddy door, that I am in love with her?</p>

<p>I leisurely filled my pipe from the hunk of
tobacco I had met with in the wreck, taking,
whilst I did so, as I stood on the quarter-deck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
a good steady look at such of the sailors as
were about, though I contrived an idly curious
manner, and directed my eyes as often at the
barque&#8217;s furniture as at the seamen. After I
had been on the poop a few minutes, Mr. Lush
left it to go forward; and with my pipe betwixt
my teeth, I lounged over to the binnacle
to see how the ship headed. The man who
grasped the spokes was the honest-faced fellow
I had before noticed at the wheel; he, I mean,
of the minute eyes and whiskers joined at his
throat, who had addressed me in the boat
whilst we lay alongside the hull. I noticed
that he seemed to stir a little uneasily as I
approached, as though nervously meditating a
speech, and I had scarcely glanced into the
compass bowl when he exclaimed: &#8216;I beg
your pardon, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;The noose,&#8217; said he, &#8216;came forrads afore
I lay aft for this here trick that the ship you
came out of and lost sight of was the <i>Countess
Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That is so,&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Might I make so bold,&#8217; he continued,
slightly moving the wheel, and bringing his
specks of eyes into a squint over my head as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he sent a glance at the tiny skysail pulling
under the main-truck, &#8216;as to inquire if so be
that the bo&#8217;sun of that ship was a man named
Smallridge?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, Smallridge; that was the boatswain&#8217;s
name,&#8217; I replied, warming up to the mere
reference to that hearty sailor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I heerd that he was agoing
bo&#8217;sun in that ship, and I was pretty nigh
signing for her myself, only that her date of
sailing didn&#8217;t give me quite long enough
ashore. And how <i>is</i> Mr. Smallridge, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well indeed,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve got a perticler respect for Mr. Smallridge,&#8217;
he continued; &#8216;he kep&#8217; company with
my sister for some time, and would ha&#8217; married
her, but she tailed on to a sojer whilst he was
away, prefarring the lobster to the shellback,
sir. Well, I&#8217;m glad to larn that he&#8217;s hearty,
I&#8217;m sure. If so be as we should fall in with
the <i>Countess Ida</i>, and put you aboard without
my seeing of Mr. Smallridge, I&#8217;d take it werry
kind, sir, if you&#8217;d give him Joe Wetherly&#8217;s
respects.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I certainly will,&#8217; said I with alacrity; &#8216;but
I fear there is little chance of our meeting
with the Indiaman.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8216;Well, there&#8217;s no telling,&#8217; he exclaimed;
&#8216;but she&#8217;ll have to be right in this here
barque&#8217;s road, supposing her to be ahead;
and if we should pass her in the dark, why,
then, good-night! for she&#8217;s like grease in the
water is this here <i>Lady Blanche</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Smallridge and I were very good friends.
He&#8217;d been a sailor in the ship I was afterwards
midshipman in.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, indeed,&#8217; cried he. &#8216;And so <i>you</i> was
at sea, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>I was about to reply, designing to lead him
on into answering certain questions I had in
my mind concerning the captain and crew of
the barque, when Mr. Lush came up the poop
ladder; so, knowing the etiquette, I hauled
off, but with the full intention of sounding Mr.
Joe Weatherly at large when an opportunity
should offer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>I KEEP A LOOKOUT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I slipped</span> half-way down the little companion
ladder to take a peep at Miss Temple, and on
observing her to be resting quietly, I returned,
and after lighting my pipe anew, stepped over
to Mr. Lush, who was employed in cutting off
a piece of tobacco from a black cake to serve
him as a quid.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is not often hereabouts,&#8217; said I, by way
of starting a conversation, &#8216;that one has a sky
like that all day long overhanging one&#8217;s mastheads.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said he; &#8216;but it&#8217;s better than the
roasting sun;&#8217; and he opened his lame mouth
to receive the cube of tobacco into the hollow
of his cheek, whilst he eyed the sky askant, as
though in recognition of it as a subject of talk.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you fall in with the smother that
ended in the lady and I being stranded aboard
the wreck?&#8217; I inquired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>&#8216;No; there&#8217;s been ne&#8217;er a smother with
us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The death of Mr. Chicken,&#8217; said I, &#8216;must
have been a blow, seeing that the barque
carried but a couple of mates.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How many mates do a ship of this size
want?&#8217; said he, without looking at me and
slowly masticating.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, she has only one now, anyway,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; she ain&#8217;t got even one,&#8217; he exclaimed,
with the manner of an ill-tempered man who
only listens for the sake of contradiction and
argument.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are not <i>you</i> second mate?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not I,&#8217; he replied with a gruff laugh.
&#8216;They calls me second mate, and I keeps
watch and watch with the capt&#8217;n as if I <i>was</i>
second mate; but what I&#8217;m signed for is
carpenter, and carpenter I be, and there&#8217;s
nothen more to be made out of me than that,
and I don&#8217;t care who the bloomin&#8217; blazes hears
me say it.&#8217;</p>

<p>He drew to the rail by a step and expectorated
violently over it. I was too
anxious for information about this little ship
and her crew to suffer my curiosity to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hindered by the man&#8217;s rough, coarse, ill-natured
speech and demeanour.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was wondering where you took your
meals,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I now understand. You live
forward?&#8217; He gave me a surly nod. &#8216;But
not in the forecastle?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where else? Ain&#8217;t the fok&#8217;sle good
enough for me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But does not association of that sort
weaken your control over the men?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;<i>I&#8217;ve</i> got no control, and don&#8217;t want none.
The men&#8217;ll run if I sing out. And what
more&#8217;s to be expected of sailors?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It seems queer, though,&#8217; said I, &#8216;since you
undertake the work of a second mate, that you
shouldn&#8217;t live aft. It must have been lonely
eating for the skipper after Mr. Chicken died?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I did live aft afore Mr. Chicken died,&#8217; he
exclaimed, biting his tobacco with temper,
whilst his weather-stained face gathered a
new shade of duskiness to the mounting of
the blood into his head; &#8216;and then when the
capt&#8217;n and me comes to be alone, he tarns to
and finds out that I ain&#8217;t choice enough to sit
down with&mdash;says I ain&#8217;t got the art of perlite
eatin&#8217;, calls me a hog to my face, and tells me
that my snout&#8217;s for the mess kid and not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
knives and forks and crockery. Him!&#8217; He
turned his face to the rail and spat again, and
looked at me with an expression of anger, but
checked himself with violence, and pushed his
hands into his breeches pockets with an irritable
motion of his whole frame.</p>

<p>I considered that enough had been said;
and though I had gained but little information,
it was at least made clear to me that
there was no love lost between Captain Braine
and Mr. Lush. But further conversation
would have been rendered impossible in any
case, for just then a man struck eight bells on
the main-deck, and a minute or two later the
wheel was relieved, the captain arrived, and the
carpenter went forward in a round-backed
sulky walk, his legs bowed, his muscular arms
hanging up and down without a swing, each
bunch of his fingers curled like fish-hooks.</p>

<p>I had talked enough, and was weary of
standing and walking; so, when I spied the
skipper, I slipped off the poop and seated myself
on a bench abreast of my sleeping companion,
where I remained for half an hour,
often gazing at her, my mind very busy with
a hundred thoughts, foremost amongst which
was the shuddering recollection of our late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
experiences and narrow escape, and deep
thankfulness to God for His merciful preservation
of us. The entrance of the captain&#8217;s
servant&mdash;a young fellow named Wilkins, to be
hereafter so called: a memorable figure in
this startlingly eventful passage of my life
which I am endeavouring to relate: a veal-faced,
red-headed, shambling fellow of some
two-and-twenty years, with white eyebrows
and lashes, and a dim blue eye&mdash;the entrance,
I say, of this man with a tray of tea-things
aroused Miss Temple, who, after a brief bewildered
stare at me, smiled, and sat upright.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is always something new now,&#8217; she
exclaimed, &#8216;to look at when I open my eyes
after sleeping. Yesterday it was the wreck;
to-day it is this ship. What will it be to-morrow?
Is there anything in sight, Mr.
Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There was nothing when I left the deck
half an hour ago,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>She had awakened with a slight flush of
sleep in her face that greatly enriched her
eyes; but the delicate glow quickly faded;
she was speedily colourless as alabaster. She
smoothed her hair and put on her hat, that
she had removed when she lay down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8216;It is strange,&#8217; she exclaimed in a low
voice, &#8216;I should not seem able to endure feeling
that I am not in a condition to instantly
leave this vessel. It was so with me in the
wreck. Even without my hat, I feel unready;
and then, again, there is the sense of not being
exactly as I was when I left the <i>Countess
Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>The captain called through the skylight:
&#8216;Wilkins, bring me some tea and a biscuit up
here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray,&#8217; said I, &#8216;when and where does the
captain dine?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I took his dinner to his cabin,&#8217; responded
the young fellow; &#8216;he mostly eats there. But
now you&#8217;re here, I allow he&#8217;ll be a-jining of
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is no meal for you, Miss Temple,&#8217;
said I, with a glance at the old teapot and
the small plate of biscuits which furnished out
the repast. &#8216;No milk&mdash;brown sugar&mdash;no
butter, of course!&#8217; Wilkins grinned whilst
he poured out some tea into a cup. &#8216;You&#8217;ve
had nothing to eat since we first came aboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I want nothing,&#8217; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, then, <i>I</i> do,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Captain Braine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
is quite right. Shipwreck doesn&#8217;t impair the
appetite.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;ll be supper at seven, sir,&#8217; said
Wilkins.</p>

<p>&#8216;And what do you call supper?&#8217; I inquired.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; answered the fellow, &#8216;there&#8217;ll be
the beef ye had this morning, piccalillis,
bottled stout, biscuit after this here pattern,
and cold currant dumplings.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then went up the companion steps with
some biscuit and tea for the captain. I
laughed out.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not so good as the Indiaman&#8217;s dinner-table,
Miss Temple, but better than the hull&#8217;s
entertainment. We must wait till supper&#8217;s
served. Meanwhile, I&#8217;ll blunt my appetite
on a biscuit. Will you give me a cup of
tea?&#8217;</p>

<p>It was genuine forecastle liquor, such as
might have been boiled in a copper, of the
hue of ink, and full of fragments of stalk.
However, the mere looking at it was something
to do, and we sat toying with our cups,
making-pretend, as it were, to be drinking tea
and talking.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wonder,&#8217; I exclaimed in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
our conversation, &#8216;whether the cutter was
picked up by one of the ships? If she lost
both of them, will she have lived in the
weather that followed? Anyway, the corvette
is certain to make a long hunt for her, with
the hope also of falling in with the Indiaman,
for Sir Edward will think it possible that
Keeling has his men aboard, and will want to
make sure. I fear this business of the cutter
may have led to such man&#339;uvring on the
part of the two ships as must render our
falling-in with one or the other of them very
unlikely.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, why do you say that?&#8217; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is but a surmise,&#8217; said I; &#8216;anyhow, I
heartily hope the cutter <i>has</i> been picked up,
if only for Colledge&#8217;s sake. The sudden loss
of the lieutenant will have dreadfully scared
him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I earnestly wish that Mr. Colledge may
have been saved,&#8217; said she with a faint glitter
of temper in her gaze; &#8216;but I could wish ten
times more earnestly that he had never been
born, or that he had sailed in any other ship
than the <i>Countess Ida</i>; for then I should not
be here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Your aunt endeavoured to dissuade you.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>&#8216;She did; and I am rightly served for not
obeying her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are very high-spirited, Miss Temple;
it is your nature, and you cannot help yourself.
You are a young lady to insist upon
having your own way, and you always get it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale, you are too young to lecture
me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How old do you think I am?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, about six-and-twenty,&#8217; she answered
with a slight incurious run of her eyes over
me that recalled her manner in the Indiaman.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, if I am,&#8217; said I, &#8216;it is a good solid
age to achieve. There is room for enough
experiences in six-and-twenty years to enable
a young man to utter several very truthful
observations to high-spirited young ladies who
insist upon having their way, and then quarrel
with everybody because their way is not
exactly the road they wish to tread.&#8217;</p>

<p>She slightly knitted her fair brows and
looked at me fixedly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; said she, &#8216;you would not
have dared to talk to me like this on board
the <i>Countess Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was afraid of you there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You <i>respected</i> me there, you mean, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
now&mdash;because&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; She came to a stop, with
a little quivering at the extremities of her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am no longer afraid of you, or, rather,
I no longer respect you because you happen
to be in this particular situation, which needs
no explanation whatever: that is, I suppose,
what you wish to say. But you misjudge me
indeed. I was afraid of you on board the
Indiaman, but I did not respect you; nay, my
aversion was as cordial as could be possibly
imagined in a man who thought you then, as
he thinks you still, the handsomest woman he
has ever seen in his life, or could ever have
dreamt of. But that aversion is passing,&#8217; I
continued, watching with delight her marvellous
gaze of astonishment and the warm
flush that had overspread her face. &#8216;I am
discovering that much of what excited my
dislike and regret aboard the Indiaman is
artificial, an insincerity in you. This afternoon,
whilst you slept, I sat near you for
half an hour, gazing at you. All expression
of haughtiness had faded from your
mouth: your countenance wore an air of exquisite
placidity, of gentle kindness, of tender
good nature. In short, Miss Temple, I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
you as you are, as your good angel knows
you to be, as you have it in your power to
appear.&#8217; I sprang to my feet. &#8216;How shall
we kill the blessed hours that lie before us?
Only think, it is barely five o&#8217;clock.&#8217;</p>

<p>She gazed at me with an amazement that
seemed to render her speechless; her face was
on fire, and her throat blushed to where the
collar of her dress circled it. &#8216;It will not do,&#8217;
I continued, &#8216;to attempt to murder time by
talking, or it will come to your killing me
instead of the hours. I&#8217;ll go and overhaul the
late Mr. Chicken&#8217;s bedroom, or, rather, his
effects. There <i>may</i> be something to interest.
Even the mouldiest backgammon board would
be worth a million;&#8217; and I made for the little
hatch that conducted to our sleeping berths,
leaving her motionless at the table.</p>

<p>Come, thought I, as I dropped into the
&#8217;tweendecks, a short spell of loneliness will do
you good, my haughty beauty, by making you
realise how it would be with you were you
actually alone. This is the first of the homely
thrusts I have been preparing for you, and I
will not spare you less as I grow to love you
more, taking my chance of your abhorring
me, though it may not come to <i>that</i> either.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>I peeped into the berth that had been prepared
for her, and found all the odds and ends
which had encumbered it gone; there was a
clean mattress on the bunk, and on top of
it an old but comely rug and a couple of
shawls; a small looking-glass dangled near
the porthole. But what an interior for this
delicately nurtured, high and mighty young
lady of quality to lie in! No carpet, no chest
of drawers, nothing beyond the looking-glass
and a tin dish for washing in; in short, a mere
marine cell, as like as might be to any little
whitewashed room with grated window ashore
in which a policeman would lock up a pick-pocket!</p>

<p>I entered my own berth. The boatswain&#8217;s
and sailmaker&#8217;s stores were not here, and I
found a &#8216;clean hold,&#8217; as a sailor might say.
In fact, all Chicken&#8217;s traps being about, caused
the berth to present a much more hospitable
aspect than the adjacent one afforded. I examined
the books, but found most of them to
consist of religious literature, as the captain
had said, and the rest of them works on the
nautical life. Though it was hard to reconcile
a fancy of cards with the late Mr. Chicken&#8217;s
character as portrayed by the skipper, I yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
looked into a couple of chests in the hope of
meeting with a pack; but neither cards nor
any species of object calculated to divert did
I come across; and growing weary of hunting,
I returned to the cuddy.</p>

<p>I perceived or imagined an air of reproach
in Miss Temple; but she had mastered her
temper and astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is nothing belonging to the late
Mr. Chicken to entertain us,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It surely does not signify, Mr. Dugdale.
Do you suppose that I have the heart
to play at cards or chess? Is not there
more wind than there was? I will ask you
to take me on deck. Something may be in
sight, and it will not be dark for some time
yet.&#8217;</p>

<p>I gave her my hand, and helped her up
the little ladder. There was more wind, as
she had said; the skysails had been furled and
a studdingsail or two hauled down, and the
little barque, with her yards almost square,
was sweeping swiftly over the smooth waters,
slightly heeling from side to side as she went.
The foam in yeasty bubbles and soft cream-hued
clouds went spinning and writhing from
her bows into her wake, that ran like a path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
of coral sand over the darkling waters, now
complexioned into lividness by the gloomy
plain of vaporous sky. The crew were on
the forecastle&mdash;it was well into the first dog-watch&mdash;lounging,
sitting, yarning, and smoking.
Amidst them I noticed Mr. Lush, leaning
against the rail with a short sooty pipe in his
mouth, the bowl of which was inverted. He
was in his shirt sleeves, and he reclined with
his arms folded upon his breast, apparently
listening, in that dogged posture, to one of the
sailors, who was reciting something with outstretched
arm and a long forefinger, with
which he seemed to be figuring diagrams upon
the air. Upon the slope of the starboard cathead,
coming into the deck, sat my friend
Joe Wetherly, with a pair of thick-rimmed
spectacles on his nose; he pored on a book
with moving lips, from which he would expel
at intervals great clouds of smoke through a
pipe betwixt his teeth. So small was the
barque, so seemingly close at hand the forecastle
to the break of the poop, that even such
minute details as these were perfectly visible
to me.</p>

<p>Captain Braine stood near the wheel. He
continuously stared at us, but did not shift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
his attitude nor offer to address us. I swept
the sea-line, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>&#8216;How sickeningly wearisome has that bare
horizon grown to me!&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple,
with a shuddering sigh; &#8216;it has just the sort
of monotony that would speedily drive me
crazy. I am sure; not the wearisomeness of
four walls, nor the tiresomeness of a single
eternal glimpse of unchanging country to be
had through a window; no! there is a
mockery in it which you do not find in the
most insipid, colourless scene on land. It is
not, and still it always <i>is</i>, the same. It recedes
to your pursuit, yet it is unalterable, and how
cruelly barren is it of suggestions!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet a sight of the Indiaman,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;should develop whatever of the picturesque
may be hidden in that tiresome girdle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah, yes!&#8217; she answered; &#8216;but we are
now running away from our chances. How
swiftly this boat sails! If the Indiaman is
behind us, we shall see no more of her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not let us depress each other with
talk of this kind,&#8217; said I; &#8216;let me give you
my arm, and we will stroll a little.&#8217;</p>

<p>We had been on deck about twenty
minutes, when the captain, who had continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to steadfastly gaze at us in a most extraordinary
ruminating way, crossed the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, sir,&#8217; said he, &#8216;could I trust you to
keep a lookout for me if I went below for a
short spell?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will do so with pleasure.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye know what orders to give, if anything
requiring orders should happen?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said I, smiling, &#8216;there are a good
many orders going at sea, you know, captain.
Figure a situation, and I will see if I can
recollect the routine.&#8217;</p>

<p>He stared at me musingly with his dead
black eyes, and then said: &#8216;Well, suppose the
breeze freshens with a dark look to wind&#8217;ard,
and I&#8217;m below and asleep, and have left ye no
instructions; what would you do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Call you,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;And quite right, too,&#8217; he cried, with a
vehement nod of approval, and a glance at
Miss Temple, as if he would have her participate
in his satisfaction. &#8216;But put me out of
the question, and allow that you&#8217;ve got to act
for yourself.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Captain Braine,&#8217; I exclaimed,
&#8216;though my time at sea was brief, I am no
longshoreman. Such a question as yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
means merely the first letter in the marine
alphabet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I ain&#8217;t so sure of that,&#8217; said he, with his
fixed regard.</p>

<p>&#8216;I admit,&#8217; continued I, &#8216;that I have never
been shipmate with a fore-and-aft rigged
mizzenmast; but if it&#8217;s merely a question of
shortening sail, why, what else under the
moon is to be done than to take in your
studdingsails and clew up your royals and
haul down your flying jib, and then let go
your foretopgallant halliards, and haul down
your light staysails&#8217;&mdash;and so I rambled on,
winding up with, &#8216;I am leaving your after-canvas
untouched, because it is already in, you
see; whilst as to your jibs and staysails, I
assume of course that they are set.&#8217;</p>

<p>He lifted his hand. &#8216;Thank&#8217;ee,&#8217; said he;
&#8216;I shan&#8217;t be long;&#8217; and down he went.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will surely believe <i>now</i> that he is
mad!&#8217; said Miss Temple with anxiety, but
softly, for the fellow at the wheel stood near,
and I had seen a grin crumple up his features
to the skipper&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>&#8216;He may want me to serve him as a mate,&#8217;
said I, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will do nothing of the kind, I hope,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
she exclaimed, as we fell to pacing the deck
afresh.</p>

<p>&#8216;I will do anything that may help me to
see you safe,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;But cannot you perceive, Mr. Dugdale,
that if he believes you fit to serve him as a
mate, as you call it, he may prevent you from
leaving his ship by declining to communicate
with passing vessels?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That is true,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am certain,&#8217; she cried, squeezing my arm
in the energy of her emotion, &#8216;that he has
some design in his mind to make you serve
him. Why should he have teased you when
we came, poor miserable creatures! fresh
from the wreck, with inquiries about your
knowledge of navigation? Oh, beware of
him! He may not be quite mad, but he may
be as wicked as the worst of his men.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We must wait,&#8217; said I, for her conjectures
were quite reasonable enough to prove disturbing.
&#8216;But after all,&#8217; I cried, brightening
up to the new idea that possessed me, &#8216;if we
are to sail to the Mauritius with him&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;No!&#8217; she exclaimed; &#8216;that is not to be
dreamt of.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet listen, I entreat you. If it is our uncomfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
doom to remain in this barque
until she reaches her port, I do not know but
that the captain would be very honestly in the
right in expecting me to work my passage&mdash;that
is to say, to help him by keeping a lookout,
and by serving him in other ways which
may be possible to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not dream of sailing to the Mauritius!&#8217;
she cried impetuously; &#8216;we must either soon
meet with the Indiaman or return home.&#8217;</p>

<p>I could not forbear a smile at her imperious
<i>we</i>, as though whatever she did I must do.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, that is what we want,&#8217; I exclaimed;
&#8216;but then if we don&#8217;t fall in with the Indiaman
nor with a vessel homeward bound&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Absurd! Dozens of ships are to be met
with every day sailing home to England from
some part or other of the world. The idea of
remaining in this vessel is not to be entertained
for an instant. It would be intolerable
enough for me even to make the comparatively
short passage home, destitute as I am of everything;
but to leisurely proceed <i>all</i> the way to
the Mauritius&mdash;&mdash; Oh, be very careful, Mr.
Dugdale. I beg you not to know anything at
all about navigation and the duties of a sailor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can&#8217;t do that,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
loaded my gun and must stick to it; but I
promise you I will put no more shot in it.&#8217;</p>

<p>She eyed me with great impatience and
warmth, as though provoked by my answer:
but she held her peace, and presently our
conversation went to other matters.</p>

<p>Shortly before six o&#8217;clock the sky cleared
somewhat to windward. The wide pall of
leaden cloud lifted there, as though it were
some huge carpet a corner of which was being
rolled up, and there looked to flow a very
lagoon of pure blue ether, moist and rich with
the evening shadow, into the space betwixt
the rim of the sea and the edge of the cloud.
A clearer, more penetrating light broadened
out; and going to the companion hatch, I
took the telescope that lay in brackets there
and carefully searched the horizon. But the
sea washed bare to the sky on all sides.</p>

<p>I did not observe that the men gathered
together on the forecastle seemed to notice
the captain&#8217;s absence, though I expected they
would come to stare a bit when the fellow who
stood at the wheel should go forward and tell
them that I had been acting as mate of the
watch. For my part this queer duty coming
upon me made the whole experience more wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and improbable to my imagination than had
been any other feature of it since we quitted
the Indiaman. Never was there such a forcing
of adventures, as it were, upon a man. It
was like dreaming to reflect that a little time
ago I was a passenger, an easy-going, smoking,
drinking, chess-playing young fellow, without
a care, with plenty of clothes and money
enough in my cabin, and that now I was a
half-starved, shipwrecked wretch, without the
value of a straw in the shape of possessions,
outside of what I stood up in and had in my
pockets, keeping a lookout as though, faith, I
was some poor, struggling, hungry second
mate, newly enlarged from an odious term of
apprenticeship! like dreaming, I say, to think
that a little time ago the young lady by my
side was a reserved, disdainful creature, with
scarcely a word betwixt her lips to throw at
me, and that now she could not speak of her
future without making me a sharer in it, that
she could not see enough of me, nor have my
arm too close for her hand; whilst in point of
destitution she, the most richly clad of the
Indiaman&#8217;s lady passengers, she, who had
seemed to me to appear in a new dress nearly
every day, was out and away more beggared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
than I; for so far as I was concerned there was
always the barque&#8217;s slop chest to come upon;
or, failing that, there would be jackets and
breeches and &#8216;housewives&#8217; enough forward to
serve my turn if the push grew severe;
whereas Miss Temple was as badly off as if
she had been cast away upon a desert island!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> captain did not again return on deck.
At six o&#8217;clock Mr. Lush&#8217;s white jacket was
forked up to him through the forecastle hatch:
he slipped it on and came aft to relieve the
watch; but though he looked about a little
for the skipper, I could not find in his wooden
face that he made anything of not perceiving
him. By seven o&#8217;clock the sky had cleared;
the wide stretch of vapour which had all day
long obscured the sky had settled away down
beyond the southern rim, and the soft violet
of the tropic evening heaven was made beautiful
by spaces at wide intervals of a delicate
filigree-work of white cloud, dainty and fine
to the eye as frost on a meadow. The setting
sun glowed in the west like a golden target,
rayless, palpitating, and a cone-shaped wake
of flame hung under him. There was a
pleasant whipping of wind over the sea, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
merry air that whitened the heads of the
ripples, and it blew sweet and warm.</p>

<p>Lush had loosed the skysails again and
sent the royal studdingsails up, and the
barque went nimbly floating through it in the
resemblance of some golden-tinctured fabric
of silver hull and sails of cloth of silver;
indeed, from the point of view of the space
of deck abaft the wheel, she showed like some
fairy creation in that atmosphere that was
brimful of scarlet light, and upon that
sapphire plain whose tender long-drawn
undulations seemed to wave a faint golden
hue through, the blue of the brine, as though
there were dyes of a westering sun-colour
rising from the heart of the deep, and then
subsiding.</p>

<p>On looking through the skylight I perceived
Wilkins placing supper on the table.
This was an unusual meal at sea, at least
aboard of a homely trader of the pattern of
the <i>Lady Blanche</i>, and was a distinct illustration
in its way, to my recollections of seafaring
life, of the odd character of the man who
commanded the barque. He came out of his
cabin as we seated ourselves, giving Miss
Temple a grotesque bow before taking his
place.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>&#8216;Sorry, mem,&#8217; said he, casting his slow eye
over the table, &#8216;that there&#8217;s nothing choicer
in the way of victuals to offer you. I find
that the wine brought aboard from the wreck
is a middling good quality of liquor, and it is
to be saved for you, mem. Wilkins, open a
bottle, and give it to the lady. Pity that
shore-going folks who take interest in the
nautical calling don&#8217;t turn to and invent something
better for the likes of me than salt pork
and beef and biscuit, and peas which are only
fit to load a blunderbuss with. There have
been times when a singular longing&#8217;s come
upon me for a cut of prime sirloin and a
floury potato, as Jack says. But the sea-life&#8217;s
a hard calling, look at it from which end of
the ship ye may. How did you get on in
your watch on deck, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217; he added
with a gaunt smile, in which I could not
distinguish the least complexion of mirth.</p>

<p>&#8216;There was nothing to be done,&#8217; said I,
working away at a piece of salt beef, for I was
exceedingly hungry.</p>

<p>&#8216;But ye&#8217;d have known what to do if there
had been?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>Miss Temple&#8217;s glance admonished me to be
wary.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>&#8216;Oh, I am no sailor,&#8217; said I, &#8216;in the sense
that you and Mr. Lush are sailors.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not Mr. Lush!&#8217; he cried, elevating his
forefinger and staring hard at me past it.
&#8216;Mr. Lush, as you term him, is a hog on two
legs. Let him go on all fours, and there&#8217;s
ne&#8217;er an old sow under a longboat that wouldn&#8217;t
take him to her heart as one of her long-lost
children. Such manners, mem!&#8217; he continued,
addressing Miss Temple, whilst with
upturned eyes and raised hands he counterfeited
an air of disgust; &#8216;when he ate, you
could hear the smack of his lips fore and aft.
He&#8217;d make nothing of laying hold of a bit of
cold beef and gnawing upon it as a dawg
might, head first on one side and then on
t&#8217;other; and you&#8217;d find yourself listening to
hear him growl, if you looked at him. And
then his language! I&#8217;ve been eating by myself
pretty nigh since Chicken died, but it&#8217;s entertainment
for me to have company;&#8217; and he
bestowed another bow upon each of us.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will not find the manners of a nobleman
in a plain ship&#8217;s carpenter,&#8217; said I,
thankful to believe that he had forgotten the
subject of my sea-going qualifications. But I
was mistaken. He gazed at me with a steadfastness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
that was absolutely confusing, whilst
he seemed lost in deep thought, then said:</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not going to regard you, Mr. Dugdale,
as a tip-top sailor, of course. Ye&#8217;ve knocked
off too long; but it&#8217;ll all come back very
soon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale was at sea for only two
years,&#8217; said Miss Temple. &#8216;It would be unreasonable
to expect anyone to know much of
a calling in that time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you believe <i>that</i>, mem,&#8217; he exclaimed.
&#8216;After twelve months of it, there was
but little left for me to larn&mdash;proper, I mean,
to fit me to sarve as able seaman aboard anything
afloat, from a hoy to a line-of-battle ship.
What don&#8217;t ye know now, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>He somewhat softened his voice as he said
this, and a queer sort of yearning expression
entered his unwinking stare.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, much, captain, much,&#8217; I answered
smiling, yet feeling somewhat bothered betwixt
these questions and Miss Temple&#8217;s
glances.</p>

<p>&#8216;You could put a ship about, I suppose.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I might do that,&#8217; I replied; &#8216;but
there would be a chance of my getting her
into irons, though.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>&#8216;You&#8217;d be able to know when to shorten
sail anyway, and what orders to give. You
told me ye could take a star?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Did I?&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly you did, sir,&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not recollect,&#8217; said Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; he exclaimed, with another of
his mirthless grins, &#8216;the lady&#8217;s afraid of
your knowing too much, sir. I don&#8217;t mean
no offence, but there&#8217;s a forecastle saying
that all the male monkeys &#8217;ud talk if it wasn&#8217;t
for their sweethearts, who advise them to
hold their jaw lest they should be put
upon.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple&#8217;s face changed into stone,
after one withering glance at the man,
whose countenance remained distorted with a
smile.</p>

<p>&#8216;Some of Jack&#8217;s sayings are first class,&#8217;
he went on. &#8216;Yes, ye told me you could
take a star. Can you find the latitude by
double altitudes?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A few trials would recall the trick, I daresay,&#8217;
I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;And of course you know how to find the
longitude by lunar observations?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray excuse me, Captain Braine,&#8217; said I;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
&#8216;but what, may I inquire, is your motive in
asking these questions?&#8217;</p>

<p>He eyed me fixedly for some moments, and
then silently nodded his head three or four
times. Miss Temple seemed to shrink slightly
as she watched him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; said he very slowly, &#8216;on
your giving me to understand that you had
sarved aboard an Indiaman, I was willing to
receive you and the lady aboard my ship.
When you came aboard, you told me that you
understood navigation. Didn&#8217;t ye?&#8217;</p>

<p>I felt the blood in my cheek as I answered:
&#8216;I have some recollection of speaking to that
effect.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then why d&#8217;ye want to go and try to
make out <i>now</i> that ye know nothing about it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am trying to do nothing of the kind,&#8217;
said I, assuming an air of dignity and resentment,
though I feared it was good for very
little. &#8216;You have questioned me, sir, and now
I ask <i>you</i> a question. I have a right to an
answer, seeing how you expect that I should
rapidly and fluently reply to you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll be talking to you afore long,&#8217; he said,
bestowing another succession of dark mysterious
nods upon me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>&#8216;Captain Braine,&#8217; cried Miss Temple, breaking
with an air of consternation out of the
cold, contemptuous resentment that had
made marble of her face, &#8216;you have rescued
us from a condition of dreadful distress, and
I have your promise that you will not lose an
opportunity to transfer us to the first ship you
meet that is homeward bound, providing we
do not shortly fall in with the <i>Countess Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I ha&#8217;n&#8217;t broke my promise yet, have
I?&#8217; he replied, rounding slowly upon her and
staring.</p>

<p>&#8216;I can only repeat,&#8217; she continued, preserving
her expression of dismay, &#8216;that any sum of
money you may choose to ask&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I know all about that, mem,&#8217; he interrupted,
but not offensively, and with a gesture
that was almost bland. He then leisurely
turned to me. &#8216;You gave me to believe this
morning, sir, that you was acquainted with
navigation?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And what then?&#8217; I exclaimed impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope that you didn&#8217;t deceive me,&#8217; he
said with a dark look.</p>

<p>&#8216;You shall have the full truth when I
know your motive in examining me in this
fashion,&#8217; said I hotly, &#8216;and not before.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>But immediately after I had spoken I was
sensible of my folly in losing my temper.
Talk as we might, vapour as we would, we
were in this man&#8217;s power: in the power of a
man who was absolutely unintelligible as a
character whether sane or mad, and the girl&#8217;s
and my own safety might wholly depend upon
our judgment and tact. He gazed at me with
eyes whose expression seemed to grow more
and more malignant, though, God knows, this
might have been my fancy, since I was in the
humour at the moment to figure all things
very blackly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Understand me,&#8217; I exclaimed, wholly
changing my manner, and speaking in a
softened tone; &#8216;if I can be of service to you
in any direction, you have but to command
me. I owe you my own and this lady&#8217;s life;
and though it is an obligation beyond my
power of discharging in full, yet it must be
my duty and happiness to diminish it in any
direction I am equal to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We will before long talk together, sir,&#8217;
said he, and then fell silent, nor did he again
open his lips during the seven or eight minutes
in which we continued sitting together at that
table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>I was exceedingly puzzled and troubled by
what had passed. What did this captain
mean by his dark mysterious nods, by his
saying that he would talk to me presently, by
his insistence in ascertaining the extent of my
nautical knowledge? It was possible, indeed,
that being the only navigator aboard his
vessel, he might consider himself in serious
need of some one to take his place if he
should fall sick. But his behaviour was
scarcely reconcilable with this plain clear
want, and it seemed certain that there was
more going to his speech and manner than
the desire that I should fill the part of mate
to him.</p>

<p>It was a fair, warm, delightful night, rich
with stars, and soothing with the dew-sweetened
wind that blew with steady freshness
over the quarter, running the pale shape of
the barque over the dark waters, as though
she were some wreath of mist that must presently
dissolve. Miss Temple and I, sometimes
walking, sometimes sitting on the skylight,
held to the deck till a late hour. She
abhorred the thought of withdrawing to the
cabin allotted to her; and short as my sleep
had been since the hour of my quitting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Indiaman&#8217;s side, I was as little willing as she
to quit the silence and coolness and beauty of
the open night for the confinement of a small
hot berth.</p>

<p>The captain had charge of the deck from
eight to twelve; but he only once approached
us to say that a lantern containing an end of
candle had been placed in each of our berths;
&#8216;and I will ask you both,&#8217; he added, &#8216;to mind
your fire, for we&#8217;re full up with dry light goods
in the steerage.&#8217; He then returned to the side
of the deck he had crossed from, and did not
again offer to approach us.</p>

<p>You will suppose that the girl and I could
talk of nothing but the captain&#8217;s intentions,
the probable condition of his intellect, and the
like.</p>

<p>&#8216;He may refuse to part with me,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;and yet be perfectly willing to send you on
board of the first homeward-bound ship we
sight. What then, Miss Temple?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I could not travel alone. It is not
endurable that such a man as Captain
Braine should compel you, against your
wishes, to remain with him! How could
he do so? How could he compel you to take
a star, as he calls it, whatever that may mean;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
and to keep watch?&#8217; She sighed deeply.
&#8216;Alas! my language is fast becoming that of
the common sailor. To think of me talking
to you about taking a star and keeping
watch!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And why not? Jack&#8217;s is a noble tongue.
Omit the oaths, and there is no dialect more
swelling and poetic than that of the sea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I detest it because it is forced upon me.
An odious and dreadful experience obliges me
to think and speak in it. Otherwise, I might
rather like it. But tell me now, Mr. Dugdale,
surely this captain could not compel you to
remain with him?&#8217;</p>

<p>This led to a deal of talk. I did my utmost
to reassure her; I exhorted her to bear in
mind that whilst we were on board the barque,
we were literally at the mercy of the skipper,
who, down to the present moment, had certainly
treated us with great humanity, though
his behaviour and conversation in the main
were undeniably of a lunatic sort. I bitterly
condemned myself for losing my temper, and
I entreated her to be patient, to control all
resentment that the man might excite by purposed
or involuntary insult, not to doubt that
he would put her on board a ship proceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
home, and to leave me to play a part of my
own that should keep us together.</p>

<p>&#8216;For,&#8217; said I, &#8216;since fate, cruel to you, but
not to me, Miss Temple, has placed you so far
in my keeping, I must be jealous of all interference
down to the very termination of our
adventure.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish for no other companion,&#8217; she
exclaimed in a low voice; &#8216;my mother will
thank you, Mr. Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And, please God, your mother shall,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;trifling as may be my claims upon her
gratitude. But however my merits may turn
out before we again sight Old England, I shall
be abundantly satisfied if I believe that you
think of me with more kindness than you
did on board the <i>Countess Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale, I thought of no one on
board the <i>Countess Ida</i>. But let us avoid
that subject&mdash;you have already been very
plain-spoken.&#8217;</p>

<p>She ceased. I made no answer, and for
some time we paced the deck in silence,
harking then back again to the old topic of
the captain&#8217;s intentions, the whereabouts of
the Indiaman, and so on, and so on. By-and-by
I looked at my watch; the dial-plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
showed clearly by the starlight. It was
eleven o&#8217;clock; and as I looked the ship&#8217;s bell
rang out six chimes, which came floating
down again in echoes out of the tremorless
pallid concavities on high. Miss Temple
was still most reluctant to leave the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am thinking of Mr. Chicken,&#8217; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Chicken&#8217;s ghost, like a hen&#8217;s egg, is laid,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;Besides, what remains of him will be
all about my bunk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh for the Indiaman&#8217;s saloon,&#8217; she cried,
&#8216;for my dear aunt, for old Captain Keeling!
How welcome would be a sight of even the
most intolerable of the passengers, say Mr.
Johnson; even that horrid little creature with
the eye-glass, Miss Hudson&#8217;s admirer.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I fear I am tolerated for the same reason
that would render Mr. Johnson endurable to
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No!&#8217; she answered quickly and warmly;
&#8216;you are incessantly personal. I do not like
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Suffer me to escort you to your cabin?&#8217;</p>

<p>She lingered yet, turning her face to the
skies.</p>

<p>&#8216;How rich are those stars! Such lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
jewels are never to be seen in the English
heavens. Mark how the meteors score the
dark spaces between the lights with scars and
paths of diamond dust! Oh that some
gigantic shadowy finger would shape itself up
there pointing downwards, to let us know
where the <i>Countess Ida</i> is.&#8217;</p>

<p>She rose from the skylight with a long
tremulous sigh, and passed her hand through
my arm that I might conduct her below.
For an instant I hung in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why do you wait? I am now ready,&#8217;
said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am debating within myself whether I
should offer to stand watch to-night&mdash;the
captain might expect me to do so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do believe you desire that I should
think you as mad as he is,&#8217; she exclaimed,
exerting pressure enough on my arm to start
me towards the poop-ladder; &#8216;you shall do
nothing of the sort with my consent. If you
wish to resume your old vocation, Mr. Dugdale,
pray wait until this adventure is ended.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Anyway, we must bid him good-night,&#8217;
said I; and with that I called out to him.
He answered: &#8216;Good-night, Mr. Dugdale;
good-night to you, mem. If there&#8217;s anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a-missing which the <i>Lady Blanche</i> can supply
let me know, and you shall have it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re extremely good, and we&#8217;re very
much obliged to you,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good-night, Captain Braine,&#8217; called Miss
Temple in her rich voice; and down we
went.</p>

<p>The cabin lamp showed a small light.
Miss Temple waited here whilst I went below
for one of the two lanterns which the captain
had told me I should find in our berths. I
was obliged to kindle a sulphur match, and I
remember cursing the tardy operation of
obtaining a light whilst I stood hammering
away with flint and steel, injuring my knuckles,
and wishing the tinder-box at the deuce. I
found the lanterns, and left one alight in Miss
Temple&#8217;s cabin, and carried my own, also
alight, into the cuddy. Miss Temple&#8217;s eyes
sparkled to the glare as I approached her,
and her face might have been a spirit&#8217;s for its
whiteness in that faint illumination vexed with
shadows as the lantern swayed to the light
rolling of the barque.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish I could sleep here,&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will be equally comfortable below,&#8217;
said I; &#8216;and what is better, quite private.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>&#8216;Did you see any rats?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;None.&#8217;</p>

<p>She took my arm with a firm clasp, and
hardly seemed willing to release me at the
hatch, though the aperture was too narrow to
admit of our descending together. When we
had gained the lower deck, she again seized
my arm and stood staring and hearkening.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; she cried, &#8216;it is very
lonely down here!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; but you are not alone. You must
have courage. I would rather you should be
next me than overhead next the captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>Yet, as I spoke, my heart was full of
pity for her. It was indeed lonely, as she
had said, with a sense of imprisonment besides,
all that way down, thinking of where we
stood, I mean, with reference to the poop.
The stowed cases in the forepart seemed to
stir as though to some internal throes to
the weak light that swung in my hand; the
atmosphere was charged with an unpleasant
smell of cargo and the mingled fumes of a
ship&#8217;s hold; and there was something of the
heat of an oven also in the air that felt to rest
with a sort of weight upon the head, due
perhaps to the fancy begotten by the nearness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
of the upper deck or ceiling as you may term
it. Small straining noises stole upon the
ear from round about in stealthy notes, as
though they were giants below moving warily.
I say I was full of concern for the poor girl.
Somehow the misery of her condition had not
before affected me as it now did.</p>

<p>&#8216;It will not last long. It will be a thing
of the past very shortly: meanwhile, keep up
your heart, and trust me as your protector
whilst God leaves me a hand to lift,&#8217; I exclaimed
with a tenderness of which I was
insensible until a little later on, when the
tones of my voice recurred to me in memory.</p>

<p>She looked at me as though she were about
to speak, yet said nothing; and releasing my
arm, she stepped to her cabin door and peeped
in.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is there anything I can do?&#8217; said I, keeping
at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>She peered awhile, and then answered: &#8216;I
think not. But that candle will not last long,
and I shall be in darkness. Or if I should extinguish
it, how am I to light it again?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you want a light,&#8217; said I, &#8216;knock on
the bulkhead. I shall hear you, and will
answer by knocking. But it already draws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
on for twelve o&#8217;clock. The dawn will be
breaking at five or thereabouts. I trust you
will sleep. You greatly need rest.&#8217;</p>

<p>I removed my cap to kiss her hand, and
met her gaze, that was fixed full of wistfulness
upon me. &#8216;Good-night, Miss Temple,&#8217;
said I. She entered her cabin looking as
though her heart was too full for speech, and
closed the door.</p>

<p>I was now feeling exceedingly weary, yet, as
I feared that she might need me, or, in some
nervous fit, knock if it were but to know that
I was awake, I filled my pipe, got into Mr.
Chicken&#8217;s bunk, and sat smoking. I cannot
express the peculiar character of the stillness
down here. It was very extraordinarily
accentuated by the sounds which at intervals
penetrated it: such as the muffled jar of the
rudder working upon its post, the dim wash of
water, startlingly close at hand, along with
the faint seething noise of the barque&#8217;s wake
hissing within arm&#8217;s reach, as it seemed, and
coming and going upon the hearing fitfully.
The suit of oilskins against the bulkhead
swayed to the heave of the fabric, and they
resembled the body of a man who had hanged
himself by the nail from which they dangled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
There was a pair of sea-boots up in a corner
with a dropsical bulging out about the foot of
them in the part where a man&#8217;s bunions would
come, and they showed so very much as if
they had just been drawn off the legs of Mr.
Chicken, that they grew ghastly presently, and
to relieve my imagination, I directed my eyes
at other objects.</p>

<p>I sat smoking and full of thought. My
eyelids were as of lead, yet my mind continued
impertinently active. The horrors we had
escaped from lay like the shadow of a thundercloud
upon my spirits; the oppression was too
violent to suffer the continuance of any emotion
of exultation over our deliverance. Dark
and dismal fancies possessed me. I thought
of Captain Braine as a man whose reason was
unsound, and who was capable of playing me
some devilish trick; I thought of the coarse
and surly carpenter, and of the charge of
murder hinted against him by the skipper. I
thought of the convicts and of the mutineer
in the forecastle, and then my raven-like
imagination going to Miss Temple, I reflected
that I was unarmed, that I had no weapon
about me but a knife, that must prove of very
little use should it come to my having to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
a fight of it for hers and my own life. Surely,
I mused, old Chicken will not have come to
sea without some instrument of self-defence,
be it blunderbuss, pistol, or cutlass.</p>

<p>I took an earnest view of the interior.
There was a locker against the bulkhead that
divided Miss Temple&#8217;s cabin from mine; I had
incuriously opened and looked into it when
searching for something to divert ourselves
with, being by the time I had come to that
locker too tired to continue overhauling the
dead man&#8217;s effects. Besides this receptacle
there were two chests of clothes and other
matters along with a bagful of things, and a
shelf over the bunk filled with odds and ends.
There was still about an hour of candle-light
in the lantern. I raised the lid of the locker,
and found within a truly miscellaneous &#8216;raffle&#8217;
of objects, as a sailor would term it: charts,
slippers, sextant in case, a number of tobacco
pipes, bundles of papers, and I know not what
besides. At the bottom, in the left-hand
corner, was a small canvas bag very weighty
for its size. I drew it out, and found about
forty pounds in gold inside it, with three
Australian one-pound notes, dark with thumbing
and pocketing, and a five-pound note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
scarcely distinguishable for dirt and creases.
I replaced the bag; and coming to the other
end of the locker, working my way to it
through a very rag-and-bottle shop of queer
gatherings, I met with the object that I was
longing for: to wit, a heavy, long, double-barrelled
pistol, with a couple of nipples and
a ramrod, and a butt massive enough to bring
an ox to earth with. There were a parcel of
bullets, and a small brown powder-flask full
in the piece of canvas in which the pistol was
wrapped; but for some time I could not find
any caps. Without them, the pistol would not
be of the least use, and my satisfaction yielded
to mortification as I continued to probe into
the locker without result. I was about to
abandon the quest in despair, when my fingers
touched a circular metal box like to those
which used to contain paste for the polishing
of boots; I fished it up, and was mighty glad
to find it filled with caps. Come, thought I,
if difficulties are to happen, I am better off
now than I was half an hour ago, anyhow.</p>

<p>All this time there had been no noise next
door, and I could but hope that Miss Temple
was sleeping. I carefully put the pistol and
its little furniture into the foot of my bunk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
and pulling off my coat and waistcoat, and
removing my shoes, I vaulted on to Mr;
Chicken&#8217;s mattress, blew out the candle in the
lantern and stretched my length. It was
hard upon two o&#8217;clock, however, before I fell
asleep. The scuttle or porthole was abreast
of the bunk, and the black disc of it framed the
low-lying stars of the horizon as they slided
up and down to the lift and fall of the hull.
My thoughts went out to the great dark ocean,
and shivers chased me, hot as the cabin was,
as I lay reflecting upon the fire and explosion
of the wreck, and upon how it would have
been with us if Captain Braine, having taken
a view of the hull, had proceeded and left us
to our fate. The noises which violated the
singular stillness down in that part of the ship
where we lay, and which had rendered me
somewhat uneasy at first, now proved lulling
as I lay hearkening to them, growing drowsier
and drowsier. There was a slumberous
monotony in the creaking and jarring of the
rudder, something soothing in the dim hissing
of the wake dying out, and then seething
afresh like the noise of champagne in a glass
held to the ear, as the frame of the barque
slightly soared and sank in delicate floating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
movements upon the under-run of the dark
swell. Perhaps by this time to-morrow we
may be aboard a ship homeward-bound, I
remember thinking: and that was the last of
my thoughts that night, for I immediately
afterwards sank into a sound sleep.</p>

<small>THE BRIG&#8217;S LONGBOAT</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> awakened by a knocking at the door.
The little cabin was bright with sunshine, that
was flashing off sea and sky upon the thick
glass of the scuttle. &#8216;Hallo!&#8217; I cried, &#8216;who is
that?&#8217; The voice of the young fellow Wilkins
responded:</p>

<p>&#8216;Capt&#8217;n Braine&#8217;s compliments, sir, and he&#8217;d
be glad to know if there&#8217;s anything you or the
lady wants which it&#8217;s in his power to supply
ye with?&#8217;</p>

<p>I got out of the bunk and opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Braine is very kind,&#8217; said I to the
veal-faced youth, who stood staring at me
with faint eyes under his white lashes and
brows. &#8216;What time is it, Wilkins?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Half-past eight, sir,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>I knocked upon the bulkhead. &#8216;Are you
awake, Miss Temple?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; she answered, her voice sounding
weak through the partition.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Braine wishes to know if you are
in want of anything it is in his power to let
you have?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There are many things I want,&#8217; she exclaimed;
&#8216;but they are not to be had, I fear.
I am afraid I shall have to use that comb. I
can do nothing with my hair, Mr. Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All right, Wilkins,&#8217; said I; &#8216;we shall be
on deck in a few minutes.&#8217; He went away.</p>

<p>I found the comb that had belonged to Mr.
Chicken on a shelf, and knocked on Miss
Temple&#8217;s door. She opened it, and an arm of
snow, of faultless shape, was projected to
receive the comb. &#8216;Thank you,&#8217; said she,
whipping the door to, and I entered my cabin,
calling out that I would wait for her there till
she was ready.</p>

<p>Happily, in respect of toilet conveniences
we were not wholly destitute. The water in
my can was indeed salt, but I contrived to get
some show of lather out of the fragment of
marine soap which I found inside of the tin
dish that served me as a wash-basin. I was
without Miss Temple&#8217;s scrupulosity, and found
old Chicken&#8217;s hairbrush good enough to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
flourish. There was a little parcel of razors,
too, on the shelf where the comb had been,
and with one of them I made shift to scrape
my cheeks into some sort of smoothness,
wholly by dint of feeling, for Miss Temple
had Chicken&#8217;s glass, and there was nothing in
my cabin to reflect my countenance. By the
time this little business was ended, and I had
carefully concealed the pistol and powder-flask,
Miss Temple was ready. She knocked
on my door, and I stepped out.</p>

<p>I could see her but very imperfectly in the
dim light of that steerage, yet it seemed to
me that there was more vivacity in her eyes,
more life in her carriage and air, than I had
witnessed in her on the yesterday. She told
me that she had slept soundly, and that her
mattress was as comfortable as her bed aboard
the <i>Countess Ida</i>.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am heartily glad to hear that,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;You found the marine soap tough, I fear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It cannot be good for the complexion, I
should think,&#8217; said she with a slight smile.</p>

<p>&#8216;How shocking,&#8217; I exclaimed, as we moved
to the hatch, &#8216;would such a situation as yours
be to a young lady who is dependent for her
beauty on cosmetics and powder! How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
would Miss Hudson manage if she were here,
I wonder?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is there anything in sight, do you know,
Mr. Dugdale? That is a more important
subject to me than complexions.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I did not ask; but we will find out.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was a brilliant morning, a wide blue,
blinding flash of day, as it seemed to my eyes
after the gloom below. The sea was all on
fire under the sun, and the wind held it
trembling gloriously. A hot and sparkling
breeze in the same old quarter gushed freshly
into the wide expanded wings of the <i>Lady
Blanche</i>, whose swift pace over the smooth
plain of ocean seemed a sort of miracle of
sailing to me when I contrasted it with the
rate of going of the <i>Countess Ida</i>. The flying-fish
in scores sparkled out from the barque&#8217;s
white sides. The foam came along her
sheathing like a roll of cotton-wool to her
wake. The ocean line ran round in a firm
edge with an opalescent clarification of the
extreme rim that gave the far-off confines a
look of crystal.</p>

<p>But I had not stood longer than a minute
gazing around me when I spied a gleam of
canvas about a point on our weather-bow. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
saw it under the curve of the fore-course that
lay plain in sight under the lifted clew of the
mainsail.</p>

<p>&#8216;A sail, Miss Temple.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where?&#8217; she cried, with her manner full
of fever on the instant. I pointed. &#8216;Oh,&#8217;
she exclaimed, bringing her hands together,
&#8216;if it should be the Indiaman!&#8217;</p>

<p>But the captain was walking aft, and it
was time to salute him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good morning, sir,&#8217; I said as I approached
him with Miss Temple at my side. &#8216;We have
paused a moment to admire this very beautiful
morning. I perceive a sail right ahead,
captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was a part of his destiny, I suppose,
that he should stare hard at those who accosted
him before answering. He carried his unwinking
dead black eye from my companion
to me, and then stepped out of the shell of his
mood of meditation as a bird might be hatched.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hope you slept pretty comfortably?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; I passed a good night; and I am
happy to know that Miss Temple rested well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Which way is that ship going?&#8217; cried the
girl, whose cheeks were flushed with impatience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>&#8216;She is not a ship, mem,&#8217; he answered;
&#8216;she is seemingly a big boat that&#8217;s blowing
along the same road as ourselves under a lug.&#8217;</p>

<p>The telescope lay on the skylight, and I
pointed it. Sure enough, the sail was no ship,
as I had first imagined, though the white
square hovering upon the horizon exactly
resembled the canvas of a large craft slowly
climbing up the sea. I could readily distinguish
a boat, apparently a ship&#8217;s longboat,
running before the wind under a lugsail; but
she was as yet too distant to enable me to
make out the figures of people aboard,
considerable as were the magnifying powers
of the glass I levelled at her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Only a boat?&#8217; cried Miss Temple, in
accents of keen disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8216;What will a craft of that sort be doing
in the middle of this wide sea?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;She may have gone adrift, as you did,&#8217;
answered Captain Braine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it imaginable that she should be the
corvette&#8217;s cutter?&#8217; cried Miss Temple, straining
her fine eyes, impassioned with conflicting
emotion, at the object ahead.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, no,&#8217; said I. &#8216;First of all, the cutter
had no sail; next, yonder boat is three or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
four times bigger than she was; and then,
even if she had a sail, I question if she could
have run all this distance in the time from the
spot she started from.&#8217;</p>

<p>I noticed whilst I spoke that Captain Braine
watched me with a singular expression, and
that his face slightly changed as to an emotion
of relief when I had concluded my answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;The lady,&#8217; said he, &#8216;is speaking of the
man-of-war cutter that rowed ye aboard the
wreck, and lost ye there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;How many of a crew?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Six men and a lieutenant; but the officer
was drowned.&#8217;</p>

<p>He took the telescope from me, and brought
it to bear upon the little sail over the bow,
and kept it levelled for some moments. He
then put the glass down and said: &#8216;Have you
had any breakfast?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not yet,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>He called through the skylight to Wilkins,
and told him to put some biscuit and tea and
cold meat upon the table. &#8216;I have made my
meal,&#8217; said he, contriving one of his extraordinary
bows as he addressed Miss Temple;
&#8216;and so, I hope, mem, you&#8217;ll excuse my presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
below. Eat hearty, both of ye, I beg. There&#8217;s
no call to stint yourselves, and I&#8217;m sorry I
can&#8217;t put anything more tempting afore ye, as
Jack says.&#8217;</p>

<p>We at once descended, both of us being
anxious to get the meal, such as it might be,
over.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why is he repeatedly saying, &#8220;as Jack
says?&#8221;&#8217; asked Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah!&#8217; I exclaimed,&#8216;and why does he stare
so? Yet, on my word, he seems an exceedingly
good-natured fellow. I assure you
we might have fallen into worse hands. No
man could make a homeward-bound ship to
rise up out of the sea or signal our whereabouts
to the <i>Countess Ida</i> when she is leagues
and leagues out of sight; but another captain
might not have shown half the friendly concern
this poor eccentric creature exhibits in
our comfort.&#8217;</p>

<p>She agreed with me, but quickly dropped
the subject as something distasteful, and spoke
of her disappointment, and of the strangeness
of meeting a small boat in the middle of such
an ocean as we were sailing through. By
some trick above my comprehension, she had
contrived to smooth out her dress, insomuch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
that a deal of its castaway aspect had left it.
She had also man&#339;uvred in some fashion with
the feather in her hat; and I told her, as she
sat opposite me, that she looked as fresh as
though she had just left her cabin in the
Indiaman.</p>

<p>&#8216;Youth must always triumph,&#8217; I said, &#8216;if
it be but fairly treated. Sleep has made your
former self dominant again: but I will reserve
all my compliments until I am able to pull my
hat off to you ashore and say good-bye.&#8217;</p>

<p>She shot a glance at me under her long
fringes, but held her peace.</p>

<p>The tea was so vile that I called to Wilkins,
who stood on the quarter-deck, to procure us
some coffee if there were any aboard; and in
a few minutes he returned with a sailor&#8217;s
hook-pot full of it from the galley. This Miss
Temple seemed able to sip without a face of
aversion. It vexed me to see her imperilling
her delicate white teeth with the hard fare
that was sheer forecastle stuff, and bad at
that; but it was not for me to give orders,
nor was I willing to protract our sitting by
inquiring if there was other food aboard.
Besides, every hour in such weather as this
might provide us with the opportunity we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
hungered for, to escape into some homeward-bound
ship with a cabin capable of affording
endurable entertainment.</p>

<p>We rose from the table, and regained the
deck. The moment my head showed above
the companion-way, the captain called to me
hastily. There was a look of disorder in his
countenance that immediately excited my
wonder; there was the alacrity of fear in his
manner; he could address me now without
a prolonged stare and his usual tardy emergence
of mind.</p>

<p>&#8216;Please, take this glass,&#8217; said he, thrusting
the telescope into my hand; &#8216;and look at
that there boat, and tell me what you
think.&#8217;</p>

<p>The smooth, swift sliding of the <i>Lady
Blanche</i> over the level surface of sea that was
running in fire and foam lines to the brushing
of the merry breeze and the sparkling of the
soaring sun, had closed us rapidly with the
boat ahead since Miss Temple and I left
the deck. The little fabric was now scarcely
more than a mile on the bow, and the
captain&#8217;s glass, when I put it to my eye,
brought her as close to me as if she were no
further off than our forecastle. She was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
large, carvel-built longboat; one of those
round-bowed, broad-beamed structures which
in the olden days used to stand in chocks
betwixt a ship&#8217;s foremast and galley, with
often another boat stored inside of her, unless
she was used to keep sheep or other live-stock
in. She was deep in the water, and as much
of her hull as was visible was of a dingy
sallow white. She showed a broad square of
dark old lug, before which she was running
with some show of nimbleness. She seemed
to be crowded with men, and even whilst I
stood looking at her through the glass, I
counted no less than twenty-seven persons.
They were all looking our way, and though it
was scarcely possible to define individual faces
amid such a yellow huddle of countenances, I
could yet manage to determine a prevailing
piratic expression of the true sort, suggested
not so much by the vagueness of swarthy
cheek and shaggy brow as by the singularity
of the fellows&#8217; apparel&mdash;the flapping sombrero,
the red sash, the blue shirt, with other details&mdash;which
but very faintly corresponded indeed
with one&#8217;s notion of the coarse homely attire
of the merchant sailor.</p>

<p>Captain Braine&#8217;s eyes were fixed upon me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
as I turned to him. &#8216;What do you think of
her, sir?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t like the look of those fellows at
all,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;I would not mind making
a bet that they are a portion of the crew of
the privateering brig from whose hull you
rescued us yesterday morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just the idea that occurred to me,&#8217; he
cried. He levelled the glass again. &#8216;A
boatful of rascals, sir. Armed to the teeth,
I daresay, and on the lookout for some such
a vessel as mine to seize and get away back
to their own waters in. And yet, it is awful,
too, to think that the creatures may be in
want of water. What&#8217;s to be done? I can&#8217;t
allow them to board: and I&#8217;m not going to
heave to, to give &#8217;em a chance of doing
so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;re overhauling them fast,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;Best plan perhaps, captain, will be to hail
them as we slide past and ascertain their
wants, if we can understand their lingo; and
if they need water, there&#8217;s nothing to be done
but to send some adrift for them to pick up.
But for God&#8217;s sake, sir, don&#8217;t let them come
aboard. They look as devilish a lot of cut-throats
as ever I saw; and besides the safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of our lives and of the ship, we have this lady
to consider.&#8217;</p>

<p>Captain Braine listened to me with his eyes
fixed upon the boat.</p>

<p>&#8216;She can&#8217;t hook on at this,&#8217; said he, as if
thinking aloud; &#8216;we should tow her under
water at such a pace. By heavens,&#8217; he shouted,
with a wild look coming into his face, &#8216;if she
attempts to sheer alongside, I&#8217;ll give her the
stem!&#8217; and springing with the agility of a
monkey upon the rail, he grasped a backstay,
and stood in a posture for hailing the boat as
we swept past.</p>

<p>Forward, the seamen had quitted the jobs
they were upon, and were staring open-mouthed
from the forecastle rail. I picked up
the glass again to look at the crowd, and
every face in the lens was now as distinct as
Miss Temple&#8217;s who stood beside me. An
uglier, more ferocious-looking set of men
never stepped the deck of a picaroon. I had
not the least doubt whatever that they were a
portion of the crew of the brig. Indeed, I
seemed to have some recollection of the boat,
for I remembered, whilst examining the brig
from the poop of the Indiaman, that I had
been struck by the unusual size of her longboat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and that the colour of her was the sallow
pea-soup tint of the fabric yonder. There
were several chocolate-coloured faces amongst
the little crowd; here and there, a coal-black
countenance with a frequent glitter of earrings
and gleam of greasy ringlets. Many of them
eyed us over the low gunwale under the sharp
of their hands; one stood erect on the thwart
through which the mast was stepped, clasping
the spar with his arm, and apparently waiting
to hail us. The steersman watched us continuously,
and now and again the boat&#8217;s head
would slightly fall off to a sneaking movement
of the helm, as though to some notion of
edging down upon us without attracting our
observation. But the barque&#8217;s keen stem
was ripping through the water as the jaws of
a pair of shears drive through a length of
sailcloth. I had no fear of the boat hooking
on; she would have to man&#339;uvre under our
bows to do that, and it needed but a little
twirl of the spokes of our wheel to drive her
into staves and to send her people bobbing and
drowning into our wake.</p>

<p>&#8216;Boat ahoy!&#8217; shouted the captain with
such delivery of voice as I should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
thought impossible in so narrow shouldered a
man.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yash! yash!&#8217; vociferated the fellow who
clasped the mast, frantically brandishing his
arms. &#8216;Ve are sheepwreck&mdash;you veel take us&mdash;ve
starve!&#8217;</p>

<p>The captain looked and hardly seemed to
know what to say.</p>

<p>&#8216;How long have you been adrift?&#8217; he
bawled.</p>

<p>The fellow, who wore a red nightcap,
shook it till the tassel danced to the violent
gestures of his head. He evidently did not
understand the question. &#8216;Take us!&#8217; he
shrieked;&mdash;&#8216;ve starve!&#8217;</p>

<p>The boat was now on the bow, within
pistol-shot from the forecastle rail.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mind your helm, Captain Braine,&#8217; I
suddenly shouted, &#8216;or she&#8217;ll be aboard you!&#8217;
for my young and, in those days, keen eyes
had marked the action of the fellow who
steered the boat, and even as I bawled out,
the head of the little fabric swept round with
a fellow in the bows flourishing a boathook,
to which was attached a length of line, and
others standing by ready to help him when he
should have hooked on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>&#8216;Steady as she goes!&#8217; cried Captain
Braine.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; shrieked Miss Temple,
&#8216;they will get on board of us!&#8217;</p>

<p>The boat&#8217;s head drove sheering alongside
into our bow just forward of the fore-chain
plates. I saw the fellow erect in her head
fork out his boathook to catch hold.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let go!&#8217; roared a voice forward. The
figure of Joe Wetherly overhung the rail,
poising either an iron marline-spike or a
belaying-pin, or some short bar of metal; this
I saw. Then he hurled it at the moment that
the boathook had caught a plate. The missile
struck the man full on the head; he fell like
a statue in the bottom of the boat, and the
boat herself ground past us as the barque,
to the impulse of her great overhanging
squares of studdingsail, swept onwards at
some seven or eight knots in the hour.</p>

<p>They were so crowded as to be in one another&#8217;s
road. I saw a dozen grimy paws extended
to catch hold of the main-chain plates
as the boat came bruising and groaning and
washing past; but the iron bars were swept
like smoke out of the wretches&#8217; frantic grip.
Never shall I forget the picture the little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
fabric offered in the swift glimpse I caught of
her as she glided past. The crowd, in their
desperate efforts to catch hold of the sweeping
projections in the barque&#8217;s side, squirmed and
surged and rose and fell like rags of meat
stirred up in a boiling stewpot. Their cries,
their yells, their Spanish oaths, the brandishings
of their arms, the fury expressed in their
malignant faces, the sudden uprootal and
crash of their one mast and sail by the fouling
of it with our mainbrace, all combine into a
memory which is not to be expressed in words.
I caught sight of a number of breakers in the
bottom of the boat along with some bags, and
was instinctively assured that they were lacking
in neither food nor water. As the boat sped
under the rail on which Captain Braine was
standing, the fellow who had been at her helm,
a brawny mulatto in a wide straw-hat, loose
red shirt, and naked feet, suddenly whipped a
pistol out of his breast, took aim at the
skipper, and fired; and then, in a breath or
two, the craft was astern, tumbling in the
seething white of our wake, lessening into a
toy even as you looked, with half of her people
getting the wreck of mast and rail inboard, and
the rest of them furiously gesticulating at us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>Captain Braine stood on the rail watching
them with an air of musing that was incredibly
odd in the face of the wild excitement
of the moment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you hurt?&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>He turned slowly to survey me, then very
leisurely dismounted from his perch, meanwhile
continuing to gaze at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said he, after an interval during
which I ran my eyes over him with anxiety,
thinking to see blood or to behold him
suddenly fall; &#8216;it&#8217;s all right. This is the
fourth time I&#8217;ve been shot at in my life; and
be my end what it will, it is certain I am not
to perish by another man&#8217;s bullet. Rogues
all, ha!&#8217; he continued, directing his dead
black vision at the boat astern; &#8216;they would
have carried the little <i>Blanche</i>, and slit our
throats. Just the sort of ship, sir, for the
likes of their trade: the heels of a racehorse
and the sober look of the honest marchantman.
Slit our throats; all saving <i>yours</i>, mem, I
expect; but only to reserve ye for something
worse than death to you, if your noble looks
don&#8217;t belie your taste.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They never could have held on with that
boathook,&#8217; said I, struck more by the man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
manner than his speech, strange as it was. &#8216;I
suppose they hoped to cling long enough to
chuck a few of their beauties aboard us.
Well, Miss Temple, let us trust that we have
now seen the very last of that confounded
privateer brig and the gallant, good-looking
chaps who stocked her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When is all this going to end?&#8217; said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;Every man of them,&#8217; exclaimed the
captain, &#8216;will have had a firearm in his
breast.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No doubt,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;the vessel must
have been handsomely furnished in that way
to judge by what we found remaining in the
cabin of the wreck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Were they starving, d&#8217;ye think?&#8217; he
exclaimed with a sudden troubled manner, as
he looked at the speck in our wake.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should say not,&#8217; said I; &#8216;there were
breakers in the bottom of the boat, and
parcels resembling bread bags aft.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Thirst is a fearful thing at sea, sir,&#8217; said
he, slowly: &#8216;it&#8217;s worse than hunger. Hunger,
whilst it remains appetite, is agreeable; but
the first sensation of thirst is a torture. I
have known &#8217;em both&mdash;I have known &#8217;em
both,&#8217; he added, with a melancholy shake of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
his head and a profound sigh; then bringing
his unwinking stare to bear upon me, he
exclaimed: &#8216;Supposing that shot had taken
effect, the <i>Lady Blanche</i> would now be without
a master; and if you wasn&#8217;t on board,
she&#8217;d be without a navigator. Less than two
sea-going heads to every ship <i>won&#8217;t</i> do. I felt
that truth when Chicken went, and I&#8217;m feeling
of it every time I catch sight of that there man
Lush.&#8217; Miss Temple and I exchanged glances.
&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, with one of his mirthless grins,
&#8216;I don&#8217;t expect those privateersmen&#8217;ll trouble
us any more;&#8217; and in his abrupt way he walked
to the compass, and stood there looking alternately
from it to the canvas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had now become so much one thing on top
of another with us, and everything happening
in a moment, so to speak, too: first our being
left on the wreck all in a breath as it were:
then our being picked up by this barque
without the dimmest prospect, as my instincts
advised me, of our falling in with the <i>Countess
Ida</i> this side of Bombay: then our destitute
condition aboard a craft whose skipper&#8217;s sanity
I was now honestly beginning to distrust, and
whose people, if he did not lie, were for the
most part a gang of scoundrels: then this
sudden narrow shave of being boarded by
above a score of miscreants whose undoubted
hope was to seize the <i>Lady Blanche</i> and to
use her in the room of their own extinguished
brig; I say it was so much one thing on top
of another&mdash;a catalogue of adventures scarcely
conceivable in these safe-going days of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
ocean mailboat, though real enough and in
one way or another frequent enough in my
time, I mean in the time of this narrative&mdash;that
I protest something of the dismay which
possessed Miss Temple visited me, though I
struggled hard in the direction of a composed
face, as we talked over the incident of the
morning, and took a view of the singular
staring figure who had charge of the barque,
and directed our eyes at the crew, all hands of
whom hung about forward, briskly yarning,
as I might suppose, about the Spanish longboat&#8217;s
attempt (and with God knows what
sympathy, I would think, as I peered at the
groups), or as we sent our eager gaze into the
blue and brilliant ocean distance in search of
any little leaning flake of white that might
flatter us with promise of escape from our
disagreeable situation.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have fully and immovably formed my
opinion on two points,&#8217; said Miss Temple to
me as we continued to pace the deck together
for some half hour after the boat had disappeared
astern: &#8216;one is, that Captain Braine
is mad; and the other that he is firmly bent
on making you serve him as his mate.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I own that I now believe he is madder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
than I first suspected,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;His
manner and language to you just now were
extraordinary. But as to his employing me
as mate&mdash;I think this: if the man is crazy, he
may easily go wrong in his navigation; if we
sight nothing that will carry us home, we
must obviously stick to the barque, and her
safety, therefore, is ours; consequently, it is
desirable, I think, that I should know what
her skipper is doing with her from day to
day; and this I can contrive by consenting to
oblige him with taking sights.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I see what you mean,&#8217; she exclaimed
thoughtfully. &#8216;I had not taken that view;
but it is a cruel one to entertain; it implies
our remaining on board until&mdash;until&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
Mr. Dugdale! this sort of imprisonment
for the next two or three months is not to be
borne.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Anyway,&#8217; said I, &#8216;you now understand
that our very safety demands we should know
where that fellow is carrying his ship. If,
then, he should request me to shoot the sun
as we call it, you will not be vexed by my
compliance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who am I, Mr. Dugdale, that you should
trouble yourself about my opinion?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>&#8216;You can make yourself felt,&#8217; said I, smiling;
&#8216;I should consider your eyes matchless
in their power to subdue. There is a little
passage in Shakespeare that very exquisitely
fits my theory of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather not hear it,&#8217; she answered,
with a slight curl of her lip and a faint tinge
of rose in her cheeks. &#8216;You once applied to
me a sentence from Shakespeare that was
very unflattering.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What was it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You compared my complexion to the
white death that one of Shakespeare&#8217;s girls
talks about.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I remember. I am astonished that your
aunt should have repeated to you what she
overheard by stealth.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not understand,&#8217; she exclaimed,
firing up.</p>

<p>&#8216;She was behind me when I made that
quotation, and I was unconscious of her
presence. She should have respected my
ignorance. I meant no wrong,&#8217; I went on,
pretending to get into a passion. &#8216;Your
complexion is pale, and I sought to illustrate
it to my little friend Saunders by an expression
of striking nobility and beautiful dignity. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
ever I have the fortune to find myself in your
aunt&#8217;s company, I shall give her my mind on
this business. How am I to know but that
her repeating what she had heard me let fall
excited in you the disgust I found in your
treatment of me?&#8217;</p>

<p>She cooled down as I grew hot.</p>

<p>&#8216;The extravagance of your language
shocks me,&#8217; she exclaimed, but with very
little temper in her voice. &#8216;Disgust? You
have no right to use that word. You were
always very courteous to me on board the
<i>Countess Ida</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Am I less so here?&#8217; said I, still preserving
an air of indignation.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do not let us quarrel,&#8217; she said gently,
with such a look of sweetness in her eyes as I
should have thought their dark and glowing
depths incapable of.</p>

<p>&#8216;If we quarrel, it will not be my fault,&#8217;
said I, disguising myself with my voice, whilst
I looked seawards that my face might not
betray me.</p>

<p>At that moment the captain called out my
name: &#8216;Can I have a word with you, sir?&#8217;
he cried along the short length of poop, standing
as he was at the wheel, whilst we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
conversing at the fore-end of the raised
deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;With pleasure,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall go into the cabin,&#8217; said Miss
Temple; &#8216;it is too hot here. You will come
and tell me what he wants.&#8217;</p>

<p>I waited until she had descended the
ladder, and then strolled over to the captain,
determined to let him know by my careless air
that whatever I did for him he must regard
as an obligation, or as an expression of my
gratitude; but that I was not to be commanded.
I believed I could witness an
expression of embarrassment in his fixed
regard that I had not before noticed in him.
He eyed me as though lost in thought, and I
waited.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you object,&#8217; said he, &#8216;to ascertain
our latitude at noon to-day?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not in the least.&#8217;</p>

<p>He seemed to grow a little brighter.
&#8216;And I should feel obliged,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;if
you&#8217;d work out the longitude.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;With pleasure,&#8217; I said. I looked at my
watch. &#8216;But I have no sextant.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have a couple,&#8217; he exclaimed; &#8216;I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
lend you one;&#8217; and down he went for it with
a fluttered demeanour of eagerness.</p>

<p>I lingered till I supposed he had entered
his cabin, then put my head into the skylight
and called softly to Miss Temple, who was
seated almost directly beneath for the air
there: &#8216;He wishes me to take an observation
with him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is that?&#8217; she answered, also speaking
softly and turning up her face.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am to shoot the sun&mdash;you know, Miss
Temple.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, pray, contrive to make some error&mdash;commit
some blunder to make him suppose&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; She
checked herself, and I heard
the captain say that it was very hot as he
came to the companion steps.</p>

<p>In a few moments he arrived on deck,
hugging a brace of sextant cases to his heart.
He told me to choose; I took the one nearest to
me, perceived that the instrument was almost
new, and as it was now hard upon the hour
of noon, applied it to my eye, the captain
standing alongside of me ogling the sun likewise.
I could see the men forward, waiting
for the skipper to make eight bells, staring
their hardest at the now unusual spectacle to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
them of two sextants at work. For my part,
I should have been shocked by the weakness
of my memory if I had not known what to
do. During the two years I had spent at sea
I was thoroughly grounded in navigation&mdash;such
as it was in those days; and as I stood
screwing the sun down to the horizon, the
whole practice of the art, so far as my education
in it went, came back to me as freshly as
though I had been taking sights ever since.</p>

<p>We made eight bells. Mr. Lush came aft
to relieve the deck, and I went below with
Captain Braine to work out the barque&#8217;s
position.</p>

<p>I smiled at Miss Temple as I entered the
cuddy; she watched me eagerly, and the
movement of her lips seemed to say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t
be long.&#8217; In fact, her face had that meaning;
and I gave her a reassuring nod ere
turning to follow the captain into his berth.
The apartment was small and cheerful, plainly
stocked with the customary details of a
humble skipper&#8217;s sea bedroom; a cot, a small
table, a cushioned locker, a few mathematical
instruments, a little hanging shelf of strictly
nautical books, and so on. His chronometer
was a good one, handsome for those days, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
a quality one would hardly expect to find in
a little trading-barque of the pattern of this
<i>Lady Blanche</i>. There was a bag of charts in
a corner, and a small chart of the world lay
half unrolled upon the table, with a bit of the
Atlantic Ocean visible exhibiting the skipper&#8217;s
&#8216;pricking&#8217; or tracing of his course down to
the preceding day.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s ink and paper, sir,&#8217; said he; &#8216;sit
ye down, and let&#8217;s see if we can tally.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was always a tolerably quick hand at
figures, and had soon completed my calculations,
feeling as though I was at sea again in
sober professional earnest. The captain
worked with extraordinary gravity; his
singular eyes overhung the paper without a
wink, and his yellow countenance, with his
blue chops and chin, wore the melancholy of
a mute&#8217;s face, mixed with an indefinable
quality of distress, as though his mental
efforts were putting him to physical pain.
We agreed to a second in our latitude, but
differed in our longitude by something over
seven miles.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll be in the right, sir&mdash;you&#8217;ll be in
the right!&#8217; he cried, smiting the table with
his fist. &#8216;It is clear you know the ropes, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
Dugdale. I&#8217;ll abide by your reckonings. And
now I want ye to do me a further sarvice.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is that, captain?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, ye may reckon, of course, that I
can write,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;but I never was
topweight with my pen, as Jack says, nor, for
the matter of that, was Chicken much of a
hand. There was some words which he was
always making a foul hawse of. Now, what
I want ye to do, Mr. Dugdale, is to keep my
log for me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All this,&#8217; said I carelessly, yet watching
him with attention, &#8216;is practically making a
chief officer of me.&#8217; He did not answer. &#8216;Of
course, I don&#8217;t object,&#8217; I continued, stimulated
more perhaps by Miss Temple&#8217;s than by my
own views, &#8216;to oblige in any possible manner
a gentleman&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am no gentleman,&#8217; said he, with a wave
of the hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;&mdash;&mdash;to whom Miss Temple and myself
owe our lives. But I may take it that it is
thoroughly understood the young lady and
myself are to quit your hospitable little ship
at the first opportunity that may offer.&#8217;</p>

<p>He regarded me in silence for I should say
at least a minute; I was positively beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to believe that he had fallen dumb. At last
he seemed to come to life. He nodded
slowly three times and said very deliberately:
&#8216;Mr. Dugdale, you and me will be having a
talk later on.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But good God, captain,&#8217; cried I, startled
out of my assumed manner of indifference or
ease, &#8216;you will at least assure me that you&#8217;ll
make no difficulty of transhipping us when
the chance to do so occurs?&#8217;</p>

<p>He was again silent, all the while staring
at me; and presently, in a deep voice, said,
&#8216;Later on, sir;&#8217; and with that stood up.</p>

<p>&#8216;How much later on?&#8217; I inquired.</p>

<p>He tapped his brow with his forefinger
and answered: &#8216;It needs reflection, and I must
see my way clearly. So far it&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m
much obliged to ye, I&#8217;m sure;&#8217; and he went
to the door and held it open, closing it upon
himself after I had stepped out.</p>

<p>At the instant I resolved to tell Miss
Temple of what had passed; then swiftly
thought no! it will only frighten the poor
girl, and she cannot advise me; I must wait a
little; and with a smiling face I seated myself
by her side. But secretly, I was a good deal
worried. I chatted lightly, told her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
there was nothing whatever significant in the
captain&#8217;s request that I should check his calculations
by independent observations, and
did my utmost, by a variety of cheerful small
talk referring wholly to our situation, to keep
her heart up. Nevertheless, secretly I was
much bothered. The man had something on
his mind of a dark mysterious nature, it
seemed to me; and I could not question that
it formed the motive of his interrogatories as
to my seamanship, and of his testing my
qualities as a navigator by putting a sextant
into my hand. Whatever his secret might
prove, was it likely to stand between us and
our quitting this barque for something homeward
bound? It was most intolerably certain
that if Captain Braine chose to keep me
aboard, I must remain with him. For how
should I be able to get away? Suppose I
took it upon myself to signal a vessel when he
was below: the hailing, the noise of backing
the yards, the clamour of the necessary
man&#339;uvring, would hardly fail to bring him
on deck; and if he chose to order the men to
keep all fast with the boat, there could be no
help for it; he was captain, and the seamen
would obey him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>These thoughts, however, I kept to myself.
The day passed quietly. Again and again
Miss Temple and I would search the waters
for any sign of a ship; but I took notice that
the barrenness of the ocean did not produce
the same air of profound misery and dejection
which I had witnessed in her yesterday. In
fact, she had grown weary of complaining;
she was beginning to understand the idleness
of it. From time to time, though at long
intervals, something fretful would escape her,
some reference to the wretched discomfort of
being without change of apparel; to the misfortune
of having fallen in with a ship, whose
forecastle people, if her captain was to be
believed, were for the most part no better
than the company of brigands whom we had
scraped clear of that morning. But it seemed
to me that she was slowly schooling herself
to resignation, that she had formed a resolution
to look with some spirit into the face of
our difficulties, a posture of mind I was not a
little thankful to behold in her, for, God
knows, my own anxiety was heavy enough,
and I did not want to add to it the sympathetic
trouble her grief and despair caused
me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>All day long the weather continued very
glorious. The captain ordered a short awning
to be spread over the poop, and Miss Temple
and I sat in the shadow of it during the
greater part of the afternoon. There was
nothing to read; there was no sort of amusement
to enable us to kill the time. Nevertheless,
the hours drifted fleetly past in talk.
Miss Temple was more communicative than
she had ever before been; talked freely of
her family, of her friends and acquaintances,
of her visits abroad, and the like. She told
me that she was never weary of riding, that
her chief delight in life was to follow the
hounds; and indeed she chatted so fluently
on one thing and another that she appeared
to forget our situation: a note almost of
gaiety entered her voice; her dark eyes
sparkled, and the cold, marble-like beauty of
her face warmed to the memories which rose
in her. I gathered from her conversation
that she was the only living child of her
mother, and that there was nothing between
her and a very tolerable little fortune, as I
might infer from her description of the home
Lady Temple had kept up in her husband&#8217;s
life, and that she still, though in a diminished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
degree, supported for the sake of her daughter,
though she herself lay paralysed and helpless,
looked after in Miss Temple&#8217;s absence by a
maiden sister.</p>

<p>I recollect wondering whilst I listened to
her that so fine a woman as she, and a fortune
to boot, had not long ago married. Was she
waiting for some man with whom she could
fall in love? or was it some large dream of
title and estate that hindered her? or was it
that she was without a heart? No, thought
I; her heart will have had nothing to do with
it. Your heartless girls get married as fast
as the rest of them. And was she heartless?
It was not easy to let one&#8217;s gaze plumb the
glowing liquid depths of her eyes, which
seemed to my fancy to be charged with the
fires of sensibility and passion, and believe her
heartless.</p>

<p>There was something wild in the contrast
betwixt the imaginations she raised in me by
her talk of her home and her pleasures with
her own beauty at hand to richly colour every
fancy she inspired&mdash;betwixt my imagination,
I say, and the realities about us, as I would
most poignantly feel whenever I sent a glance
at old Lush. He was a mule of a man, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
stood doggedly at a distance, never addressed
nor offered, indeed, to approach us, though
sometimes I would catch him taking me in
from head to toe out of the corner of his surly
eyes. Possibly, my showing that I had a trick
of navigation above his knowledge excited
his spleen; or maybe his hatred of the captain
led him to dislike me because of the apparent
intimacy between the skipper and me. Anyway,
I would catch myself looking at him now
with a feeling of misgiving for which I could
find no reason outside of the mere movement
of my instincts.</p>

<p>It was in the second dog-watch that
evening; Miss Temple was resting in the little
cuddy, and I stepped on to the main-deck to
smoke a pipe. The topmost canvas of the
barque delicately swayed under a cloudless
heaven that was darkly, deeply, beautifully
blue with the shadow of the coming night.
A large star trembled above the ocean verge
in the east; but the glow of sunset still
lingered in the west over a sea of wonderful
smoothness rippling in frosty lines to the
breeze that gushed from between the sunset
and the north.</p>

<p>The carpenter had charge of the deck; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
captain was in his cabin. Whilst I lighted
my pipe, I caught sight of the man Joe
Wetherly seated on the coaming of the fore-hatch
past the little galley. He was puffing
at an inch of dusky clay with his arms folded
upon his breast, and his countenance composed
into an air of sailorly meditation.
This seemed an opportunity for me to learn
what he had to tell or might be willing to
impart about the inner life of the <i>Lady Blanche</i>,
and I went along the deck in an easy saunter,
as though it was my notion to measure the
planks for an evening stroll. I started when
abreast of him with a manner of pleased
surprise.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! it is you, Wetherly? My old
acquaintance Smallridge&#8217;s friend! No sign
of the Indiaman, though. I fear we have
outrun her by leagues. And always when
you are on the lookout for a sail at sea,
nothing heaves into sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>He rose to my accost, and saluted me with
a respectful sea-bow, that is, by scraping his
forehead with his knuckle with a little kick
back of his left leg.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s right enough, sir,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;I&#8217;ve been sailing myself in a ship for six weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
in middling busy waters, too, with ne&#8217;er a
sight of anything&mdash;not so much as the tail of
a gull.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray sit,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I&#8217;ll keep you company.
This is the right spot for a smoke and a
yarn; quiet and cool and out of the road of
the poop.&#8217;</p>

<p>He grinned, and we seated ourselves side by
side. I talked to him first about the <i>Countess
Ida</i>, explained the circumstance of my being in
company with Miss Temple, told him who she
was, and spoke of her shipwrecked condition so
far as her wardrobe went, and how eager she
was to return to England; but the old sailor
made very little of her being in want of a
change of dress.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is no need, sir,&#8217; said he, &#8216;for the lady
to distress her mind with considerations of a
shift o&#8217; vestments. I allow she can use a needle
for herself; there&#8217;s needles and thread at her
sarvice forrads; and how much linnen do she
want? Why one of the skipper&#8217;s table-cloths
&#8217;ud fit her out, I should say.&#8217; He turned his
figure-head of a face upon me as he added:
&#8216;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t the loss of clothes, sir, as should occupy
her thoughts, but the feeling that she&#8217;s been
took off that there wreck and is safe.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>I fully agreed with him, with some inward
laughter, wondering what Miss Temple would
think if she had overheard his speech. One
thing led to another; at last I said:</p>

<p>&#8216;Wetherly, I am going to ask you a plain
question; it is one sailor making inquiry of
another, and you&#8217;ll accept me as a shipmate, I
know.&#8217; He nodded. &#8216;Is not your captain
wanting?&#8217; and I touched my head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; he answered after a pause, &#8216;<i>I</i> think
so, and I&#8217;ve been a-thinking so pretty nigh ever
since I&#8217;ve been along with him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What caused his mate&#8217;s death?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He died in a swound,&#8217; he answered&mdash;&#8216;fell
dead alongside the wheel as he was looking into
the compass.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Have the sailors noticed anything queer
in their captain?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re such a party of ignorant scow-bankers,&#8217;
said he, with a slow look round, to
make sure that the coast was clear, &#8216;that I
don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;re capable of noticing anything
if it ain&#8217;t a pannikin of rum shoved under
their noses.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t mind whispering to you,&#8217; said I,
&#8216;that the captain hinted to me they were not
a very reputable body of men&mdash;talked vaguely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of mutineers and convicts, with one fellow
amongst them,&#8217; I went on, bating my voice to
a mere whisper, &#8216;who had committed a
murder.&#8217;</p>

<p>He stared at me a moment, and then tilted
his cap over his nose to scratch the back of
his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;ll know more about &#8217;em, then, than I
do,&#8217; he responded; &#8216;they&#8217;re ignorant enough to
do wrong without troubling themselves much
to think of the job when it was over. Mutineering
I don&#8217;t doubt some of &#8217;em have practised.
As to others of &#8217;em being convicts, why who&#8217;s
to tell? Likely as not, says I. But when it
comes to murder&mdash;a middling serious charge,
ain&#8217;t it, sir? Of course I dunno&mdash;who might
the party be, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh!&#8217; I exclaimed, &#8216;it was a vague sort of
talk, as I told you. But if Miss Temple and
I are to stick to this ship till we get to the
Mauritius, it would comfort her, and me, too,
for the matter of that, to learn that her crew
are not the band of ruffians we have been led
to imagine them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, sir,&#8217; he exclaimed thoughtfully&mdash;&#8216;I&#8217;m
sure you&#8217;ll forgive me, but I don&#8217;t rightly
recollect your name.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>&#8216;Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, Mr. Dugdale, as you asks for my
opinion, I&#8217;ll give it ye. Of course, it&#8217;ll go no
furder, as between man and man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly not. I am myself trusting
you up to the hilt, as what I have said must
assure you. You may speak in perfect confidence.&#8217;</p>

<p>He cast a cautious look round: &#8216;There&#8217;s
but one man to be regularly afeerd of, and
that&#8217;s Mr. Lush. I believe he&#8217;d knife the
capt&#8217;n right off if so be as he could be sure we
men wouldn&#8217;t round upon him. I don&#8217;t mean
to say he han&#8217;t got cause to hate the capt&#8217;n.
He&#8217;s a working man without knowledge of
perlite customs, and I believe the capt&#8217;n&#8217;s said
more to him than he ought to have said; more
than any gen&#8217;leman would have dreamt of
saying, and all because this here carpenter
han&#8217;t got the art o&#8217; dining in a way to please
the eye. But this here Mr. Lush feels it too
much: he&#8217;s allowed it to eat into his mind;
and if so be there should come a difficulty, the
capt&#8217;n wouldn&#8217;t find a friend in him, and so I
tells ye, sir. I don&#8217;t want to say more n&#8217;s
necessary and proper to this here occasion
of your questions; but though the crew&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
desperate ignorant one, ne&#8217;er a man among &#8217;em
capable of writing or spelling any more&#8217;n the
carpenter hisself, there&#8217;s only <i>him</i> to be afeerd
of, so far as I&#8217;m capable of disarning; though,
of course, if he should tarn to and try and
work up their feelings, there&#8217;s naturally no
telling how the sailors &#8217;ud show.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They seem a pretty smart set of fellows,&#8217;
said I, finding but little comfort to be got out
of this long-winded delivery; &#8216;the ship is beautifully
clean, and everything looks to be going
straight aboard of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh! every man can do his bit,&#8217; he answered;
&#8216;but if I was you, sir, being in charge,
as you are, of a beautiful young lady, for the
likes of which this here little barque, with
nothen but men aboard and such shabby food
as goes aft, is no proper place&mdash;if I was you,
I says, says I, I&#8217;d get away as soon as ever I
could.&#8217;</p>

<p>I mentally bestowed a few sea-blessings on
the head of this marine Job&#8217;s comforter, but
contrived, nevertheless, to look as though I
was much obliged to him for his information
and advice; and after we had continued discoursing
on a variety of nautical topics for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour
longer, I proceeded aft, and spent the rest of
the evening in conversing with Miss Temple
in the cabin or in walking the deck with her.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
